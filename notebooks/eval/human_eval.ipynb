You can define a similarity measure (function) and use that to find the closest incorrect term, in order to return the correct term for it. If you don't have all the correct words, then it's a problem. You should look for a vocabulary of 'legal' terms (or names in your case) and use that as your dictionary. There are some libraries in python that can do that for you, but as far as I know these are all based on regular dictionaries, like the ones used by LibreOffice for example (PyEnchant) is one example for that. If you're looking for a dictionary for names, you should perhaps try looking for a specific dataset that consists of names.  Otherwise your data should be in a different format, which will have more information in it, such as context for example.  One way to 'predict' correct words based on incorrect words is constructing a LM (Language Model) for each (correct and incorrect) and based on probabilities returning the ones with maximal likelihood, like a basic translation model. But this will only make sense if you have a lot of text (not unigrams) and each word appears several times, otherwise you don't really have a way to construct the LMs. The task that you are trying to do is really difficult to accomplish using machine learning as there is no pattern in how the corrected words are produced from incorrect words.

Most methods seem to rely on non-machine learning methods like string similarities and Levenstein distances. A reasonable deep learning based approach to this problem would be a Recurrent Neural Network. An LSTM (Long short term memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) would be ideal. The idea is to have an RNN which has an internal state and respects the order in which the inputs are fed.  Unlike text classification, sentiment analysis or sequence generation, the preferred encoding for the text here would be at a character level instead of word level.  For example  Christian Douglas,Chris,1 Jhon Stevens,Charlie,0   would become  [C,h,r,i,s,t,i,a,n, ,D,o,u,g,l,a,s, ,C,h,r,i,s] --  [1] [J,h,o,n, ,S,t,e,v,e,n,s, ,C,h,a,r,l,i,e]       --  [0]   The two strings to be matched are concatenated into a single sequence. The intuition here is that the RNN would process the sequence character by character and learn (read update weights) that the characters at the end have a similar pattern to what it saw earlier in the same sequence to deduce that it should be a 1 instead of 0.   The vector of [1/0] is the target variable.   The standard RNN pre-processing steps apply as usual - we'll pad the sequences in the beginning so that they're all the same length (say 50), the characters would be encoded as numeric instead of string etc.   Since the dictionary here is pretty small (26 alphabets + space + pad), the network architecture can be a fairly simple one. A single embedding layer + recurrent layer should suffice.   Framing the problem in this manner allows us to use a vanilla RNN or an out-of-the-box LSTM/GRU instead of creating a custom architecture that takes two separate strings as input for each data point and throws out a number.  You could give this approach a shot and see if is able to satisfactorily beats baseline models.  A good reading for character level RNNs is Andrej Karpathy's blog and code. The problem he's trying to solve is different and the code is in pure numpy but it still captures the idea pretty well.  I had a similar problem in my last job. My solution was to build features via (transformation(s) + comparison) * many combos and feed to models, then aggregate and model, i.e. 2 layer model. The key is encoding and similarity scores as features.  Transforms: remove vowels (great for certain roots), remove end vowels, remove double characters, convert to phonetic string (IPA, soundex, https://pypi.org/project/Fuzzy/), replace characters that either sound similar or have different sounds in other languages ($J$ in East Europe sounds like $Y$ in US, $C$ can sound like $K, D~T, Tsim TH$, etc), ... The strategy is to handle lots of weirdness/irregularity in people's names.   Comparisons (similarity and difference): try [character level, block/root/[pre/suf]fix level, word level (may not apply to you)] similarity and difference scores. Try Dice's coefficient, Levenshtein, NeedlemanWunsch, Longest common (non)contiguous substring, character histogram similarity, # characters matching, not matching (each left and right), etc. You could try using an RNN/LSTM and have it learn similarity for each transform. Use the output of the trained model(s) as another feature.  Experiment with different combos of the above and select a few that seem to have value. You could simply take all the scores and fit with Logistic Regression (or Neural Net) or you could build statistical models and output percent rank based on a small training set to normalize it. Another way to preprocess the raw scores is to use calibration encoding via logistic function. Then add summary stats from the normalized scores as additional features. Push all this into the final model.  Will you handle names that are derived from Arabic, Spanish, French, etc names? This is just extra, but consider downloading the Social Security and US Census name stats data to enhance your project with more name variations. I'll leave the how to you, but it helps knowing about the likely possibilities. Be aware that simply using Levenshtein doesn't work so well with William->Bill, Dianne->Di, Larry->Lawrence, Mohammed->Muhamed and Hamed, Danielle->Daniela, Thomas->Tom, and Jimmy->James. The strategy I mentioned should help you with all the variation.

But for training such models you need lots of data actually (to be more precise, you need long Time-Series). In this solution, the task is to see that unique and recognizable number in the prediction and output is a failure. See this for more info. Hidden Markov Models are also designed for such tasks.   Another idea could be:   Segment each time series into intervals ending in a failure. For example:     ts1 = [1,2,1,2,F,1,2,3,4,F1,2,F]    Becomes    ts1_1 = [1,2,1,2]   ts1_2 = [1,2,3,4]   ts1_3 = [2]   Now you have a set of training samples (positive samples only!) for Time-Series 1 (e.g. Temperature). Now produce some negative samples from those sequence segments which do not result in \"F\" and train a model for e.g. classifying. Then on real-time prediction, you need to make a prediction after receiving every new point (temp for instance) and see if it is going to result in a failure.

For the matrix, you start with the actual dimensions of the number and then use the corresponding scalar function to compute the sum of those dimensions. However, there are a lot of different kinds of matrices, so it is much more accurate to use a linear transform. If you had the size of the matrix and just started from the center of the input line and did your usual linear operations, you would end up with a 3D (or 4D) matrix, whereas if you knew the size of the real-valued number you would end up with a 2D matrix.

But python is actually an abstraction of the type of code known as SSE (perhaps not directly derived from the python code). And with this kind of code, you would not want the main operation to be unnecessary - just to process the data of the dependencies without breaking any others.

Fermat himself worked at Fermat’s University and originally predicted that the Thesis (Fermat’s Thesis) would take up a volume of 100,000 bytes and we could only fit 350,000 bytes in the Thesis and so on. Fermat did a lot of thinking and decided that some ridiculous features of Fermat’s Thesis and Fermat's Field (Fermat’s fields), such as Fermat’s Thesis 2, Fermat’s Field 3, Fermat’s Field 4, Fermat’s Field 5, Fermat’s Field 6, Fermat’s Field 7, Fermat’s Field 8, and so on, would take up a space of 1000 bytes. Fermat found that if you can put the most efficient locations of these part of the Thesis to occupy those 500,000 bytes of space, you can actually recreate the Thesis that is currently occupying 500,000 bytes. Fermat noticed that the MP4 in Fermat’s Field 2 take up over 100,000 bytes because there are 2.0 hyper versions of this part of the Thesis, while in Fermat’s Field 3 there are 3.2 hyper versions of this part of the Thesis. These 2.0 hyper versions are expanded into such a manner that they are almost indistinguishable from the actual part of the Thesis that currently occupies 100,000 bytes. The ELI5 version is that the MP4 has a way of doing math that is too slow and takes up too much room that we can use other shortcuts to accomplish it. However, since Fermat was a very smart dude, he decided to make these shortcuts bigger. The smart dude realized that even if you put more efficient parts of the long division of the Thesis, you would still only have ~100,000 bytes of space, which is far less efficient than 100,000,000 bytes. So he made the long division of the Thesis smaller than the actual part of the Thesis we are currently occupying.\",\n","  'question:': 'Occasional deep pits on validation accuracy graph I\\'m training FER2013 data on a custom inceptionv3 architecture that have fewer layers and params (3.3M) than the vanilla one (25M).

Here are just a few of them:    cosine distance, inner product between document feature vectors;  LSA, another vector-based model, but utilizing SVD for de-noising original term-document matrix;  WordNet-based, human verified, though hardly extensible.   Start with a simplest approach and then move further based on issues for your specific case.  State of the art appears to be  paragraph vectors  introduced in a recent paper. Cosine/Euclidean distance between paragraph vectors would likely work better than any other approach. This probably isn't feasible yet due to lack of open source implementations. Next best thing is cosine distance between LSA vectors or cosine distance between raw BOW vectors. Sometimes it works better to choose different weighting schemes, like TF-IDF. There's a number of different ways of going about this depending on exactly how much semantic information you want to retain and how easy your documents are to tokenize (html documents would probably be pretty difficult to tokenize, but you could conceivably do something with tags and context.)  Some of them have been mentioned by ffriend, and the paragraph vectors by user1133029 is a really solid one, but I just figured I would go into some more depth about plusses and minuses of different approaches.   Cosine Distance - Tried a true, cosine distance is probably the most common distance metric used generically across multiple domains. With that said, there's very little information in cosine distance that can actually be mapped back to anything semantic, which seems to be non-ideal for this situation. Levenshtein Distance - Also known as edit distance, this is usually just used on the individual token level (words, bigrams, etc...). In general I wouldn't recommend this metric as it not only discards any semantic information, but also tends to treat very different word alterations very similarly, but it is an extremely common metric for this kind of thing LSA - Is a part of a large arsenal of techniques when it comes to evaluating document similarity called topic modeling. LSA has gone out of fashion pretty recently, and in my experience, it's not quite the strongest topic modeling approach, but it is relatively straightforward to implement and has a few open source implementations LDA - Is also a technique used for topic modeling, but it's different from LSA in that it actually learns internal representations that tend to be more smooth and intuitive. In general, the results you get from LDA are better for modeling document similarity than LSA, but not quite as good for learning how to discriminate strongly between topics. Pachinko Allocation - Is a really neat extension on top of LDA. In general, this is just a significantly improved version of LDA, with the only downside being that it takes a bit longer to train and open-source implementations are a little harder to come by word2vec - Google has been working on a series of techniques for intelligently reducing words and documents to more reasonable vectors than the sparse vectors yielded by techniques such as Count Vectorizers and TF-IDF. Word2vec is great because it has a number of open source implementations. Once you have the vector, any other similarity metric (like cosine distance) can be used on top of it with significantly more efficacy. doc2vec - Also known as paragraph vectors, this is the latest and greatest in a series of papers by Google, looking into dense vector representations of documents. The gensim library in python has an implementation of word2vec that is straightforward enough that it can pretty reasonably be leveraged to build doc2vec, but make sure to keep the license in mind if you want to go down this route   Hope that helps, let me know if you've got any questions. Empirically I have found LSA vastly superior to LDA every time and on every dataset I have tried it on. I have talked to other people who have said the same thing. It's also been used to win a number of the SemEval competitions for measuring semantic similarity between documents, often in combinations with a wordnet based measure, so I wouldn't say it's going out of fashion, or is definitely inferior to LDA, which is better for topic modelling and not semantic similarity in my experience, contrary to what some responders have stated.   If you use gensim (a python library), it has LSA, LDA and word2vec, so you can easily compare the 3. doc2vec is a cool idea, but does not scale very well and you will likely have to implement it yourself as I am unaware of any open source implementations. It does not scale well as for each document, a new and separate model has to be built using SGD, a slow machine learning algorithm. But it will probably give you the most accurate results. LSA and LDA also don't scale well (word2vec does however), LDA scales worse in general. Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD.  One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as 'use word2vec', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity.   I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well. However, there's no free lunch, so preferably try each method and see which works better for your data. It is useful to have in you bag of tools the family of locality sensitive hashing algorithms. This family is not semantic at all.  Actually is consider the text as a sequence of bits. I find it useful in dirty data sets when the same text appears many times with slight differences.  You can use ssdeep (which is based on Nilsimsa hash) for identifying such documents. Ssdeep was originally planned for the domain of spam. Spammers often do small changes in the message (add a space) in order to prevent detection by exact signature (e.g., md5).  Since many version of almost the same document in the same data set will cause havoc to statistical methods that will be applied on it, doing such a cleanup can be very beneficial. \",\n","  'gen:': 'To give a simple example of a good binary-based distance, a video will have a length of up to 23 megabytes and a length of down to 30 megabytes.

I will also mention that in most digital structures, certain data has to be separated up. Let\\'s take a third example. For human characters, a work like a Facebook post is just a single character, but the text has to be separated into lots of different columns called *letters*. One column has all of the numbers that follow the signature \"E\", another column has all of the numbers that follow \"Y\", etc. There are several \"differences\" in these columns, but the most important are: * the space required for a letter to be followed by a number * the space required for a number to follow by a number * the space required for a number to follow by a number and a time value * the space required for a number and an external date value * the length of the username * the space required for an external date value * the length of the username * the length of the username\\'s internal date value Most computers support this by having a conversion table for each letter, and to break it down, each column is stored by a different unit. The various conversions tables are organized according to different factors like *size*, the number of letters, and whether the character character\\'s set is big enough. This means that for example, if I have 4 different levels of readability for each letter, the conversion table can usually work out to about one:56 which is close enough to the UTF standard. So, in this case, my first column contains the letter \"E\", second column contains the number \"Y\", etc. But it also contains the letter \"A\", which, from my table, is only the number 56. So for this situation, it will likely be 6.56. And so on.',\n","  'question:': 'What are some standard ways of computing the distance between documents?

The longer a model is in use, the more data is required. We will use a plan that repeats its effect around the globe and set the key constants. Sometimes, it is practical to look at the large range of weather events, but otherwise you have to pick a strong reference point. As this becomes more and more important, the cost of redesigning the model from initial use becomes more significant. For example, a human would need to redesign his model from a new reference, making the cost of the model irrelevant to the potential safety of the systems. Alternatively, you can dismantle the model before redesigning. Once you have a strong reference, it's possible to try to make changes in the model as necessary. Consider the principle of WTO where you can use velocities and waves to predict the impact of an earthquake. This uses a similar model (the waves) and takes the environment into account, but then it also turns into a challenge to use any material as predictive as it is (the materials are extremely expensive). This requires a heavier testing to be done, and also has a cost issue when manufacturing. The same principle applies to climate. This model has some useful simulations of an atmosphere, but has a heavy cost (the things you need to determine in a laboratory environment are not cheap) and also has limits on how you can modify its models. This leads to the idea of WTO where you can choose a certain function and consider the changes that are necessary, and then those changes may not be required when they are done. This model seems like an ideal model, but if we start making such decisions in the real world, the costs become prohibitive. Given that we only have a few months to make the necessary changes, it's better to use an ideal model than to make some changes that might not actually be needed.

You should be able to see how well your data is clustered.  I just want to chime in and highlight that using clustering to segment your data before modelling might be a bad idea.  At a high level, clustering is a two/three dimensional visualisation of similarity.  If you have two/three dimensions to your dataset you're probably OK using clustering to segment your data as all the possible relationships are being visualised by the clustering.  However if you have more than three variables than this you won't be able to visualise all the possible relationships meaning that using the 2D/3D clustering might find patterns that are not there. See Steinbach, Ertz, and Kumar for more information.  That being said you could use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to two/three dimensions and then cluster your population- but this is situational.  By reducing the dimensionality of your dataset to get cluster-able results you might be throwing away information that would be useful when it comes to modelling.  Also: I'd recommend using a more formalised metric for deciding the adequacy of your clustering see here - maybe you're using too many/not enough clusters?

The gist of what I do is throw out a sample of all observations made over a 10 year period. They test the different models and also the large variety of possible cluster points we might be interested in, but the fundamental gist is the idea that we should take some measurements with a whole bunch of variables and return back the most likely one. For example, if the point cluster is low density, and we have done three deployments of models from that point(matching with the observed mean) the most likely assumption for a cluster will be a minimum of 7, given that our observations include a lot of configurations of data, but the best-fit number of data is 7. That also applies to our models about clusters where we have a mix of different methodologies, and these should be compared against the aggregate for the moment and one will be more likely to be correct. For this to work, we need a process to study all of the clusters, which takes some time and allows our predicted cluster structure to be tested before a new and unified model is developed.

Note: S_1 = S_2 * T_3 * A^B With N_N, we already have a large number of N, so when X and Y are added together we're just multiplying them by the square root.

When the convolution has multiple output channels, we need to carry out batch normalization for each of the outputs of these channels, and each channel has its own scale and shift parameters, both of which are scalars. Assume that our minibatches contain  m  examples and that for each channel, the output of the convolution has height  p  and width  q .

However, the assumption of similar contributions is no longer true for convolutional neural networks.

To achieve this, we jointly normalize all the activations in a minibatch, over all locations. In Alg. 1, we let $mathcal{B}$ be the set of all values in a feature map across both the elements of a mini-batch and spatial locations  so for a mini-batch of size $m$ and feature maps of size $p times q$, we use the effective mini-batch of size $m^prime = vert mathcal{B} vert = m cdot pq$. We learn a pair of parameters $gamma^{(k)}$ and $beta^{(k)}$ per feature map, rather than per activation.

These doesn\\'t exist an absolute solution for the your question, but I can suggest you some techniques which may help. If I\\'m not wrong, then you\\'re basically trying to interpret the English language into human emotions. There are complete theories written on the subject, and after doing a little bit of research, I\\'ve come up with two things that might prove to be handy in your case.    Affective Computing  The main idea is, that you collect the verbal data (as much as you can), and you apply machine learning algorithms (classification) on the verbal data to figure out whether the verbal data is related to \"happiness\", or not. You can think of as many important features as you can. One feature can be, that you can assign a number to each word, like (happy=1, happier=3, happiest=10)...this is just an example. Another feature can be, that you try to figure out \"nots\" and \"negations\" in your sentence, because \"not happy\" will obviously get you to a negative value in your feature. You can think of as many similar linguistic features as you can. After having a reasonable number of calculated features, you can simply apply the algorithms mentioned, and you may eventually get to a point. Sentiment Analyzer  I just found this research paper, and it works with Natural Language Processing, and after processing the language, it analyzes the emotions of the person, or the source. You can go through the study by yourself.  Why don\\'t you empirically derive happiness based upon a sampling of the population of your texts (i.e. facebook comments). You can recruit reviewers (either \"naive\" participants or perhaps experts in psychology/emotion depending upon your needs). Give reviewers some sort of scale to rate texts on - either classify texts as positive, negative, or neutral OR have them rate texts on a likert type scale, e.g., on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being max, how happy do you think this text is?). By having multiple reviewers you can set thresholds for reliability thresholds (e.g., 2 out of 3 reviewers must agree on assignment/score;  2 reviewers come to consensus on disagreement, etc.). This data then becomes your labelled training data that you can use to score your remaining data.

When using the same words in the same context, you should probably pick a word that causes a maximum amount of joy and surprise. Consider this example: \"positive\" is the word used on a user\\'s log in, when the user\\'s log is a very sensitive social and psychological tool (we all communicate by evoking emotions through words or symbols). This makes it a good tool to use when deciding the way to evaluate happiness. This example is also interesting because it provides a huge number of contextual indicators (statistically subjective factors) of how you feel about a word or expression.

So that\\'s the reason why there\\'s a difference.  Using LDA for document modeling, one treats each \"topic\" as a distribution of words in some known vocabulary.  For each document a mixture of topics is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, and then each word in the document is an independent draw from that mixture (that is, selecting a topic and then using it to generate a word).  For HDP (applied to document modeling), one also uses a Dirichlet process to capture the uncertainty in the number of topics.  So a common base distribution is selected which represents the countably-infinite set of possible topics for the corpus, and then the finite distribution of topics for each document is sampled from this base distribution.  As far as pros and cons, HDP has the advantage that the maximum number of topics can be unbounded and learned from the data rather than specified in advance.  I suppose though it is more complicated to implement, and unnecessary in the case where a bounded number of topics is acceptable. Anecdotally, I\\'ve never been impressed with the output from hierarchical LDA. It just doesn\\'t seem to find an optimal level of granularity for choosing the number of topics. I\\'ve gotten much better results by running a few iterations of regular LDA, manually inspecting the topics it produced, deciding whether to increase or decrease the number of topics, and continue iterating until I get the granularity I\\'m looking for.

I wanted to point out, since this is one of the top Google hits for this topic, that Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP), and hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) are all distinct models.  LDA models documents as dirichlet mixtures of a fixed number of topics- chosen as a parameter of the model by the user- which are in turn dirichlet mixtures of words. This generates a flat, soft probabilistic clustering of terms into topics and documents into topics.   HDP models topics as mixtures of words, much like LDA, but rather than documents being mixtures of a fixed number of topics, the number of topics is generated by a dirichlet process, resulting in the number of topics being a random variable as well. The \"hierarchical\" portion of the name refers to another level being added to the generative model (the dirichlet process producing the number of topics), not the topics themselves- the topics are still flat clusterings.  hLDA, on the other hand, is an adaptation of LDA that models topics as mixtures of a new, distinct level of topics, drawn from dirichlet distributions and not processes. It still treats the number of topics as a hyperparameter, i.e., independent of the data. The difference is that the clustering is now hierarchical- it learns a clustering of the first set of topics themselves, giving a more general, abstract relationships between topics (and hence, words and documents). Think of it like clustering the stack exchanges into math, science, programming, history, etc. as opposed to clustering data science and cross validation into an abstract statistics and programming topic that shares some concepts with, say, software engineering, but the software engineering exchange is clustered on a more concrete level with the computer science exchange, and the similarity between all of the mentioned exchanges doesn\\'t appear as much until the upper layer of clusters. Actually HDP require a lot of hidden parameters, which are in code. If you play with such parameters you will get different results (different topics). People usually does not pay attention to such hidden parameters and thinks that model able to find such parameters. It is not true. User have to define parameters eta gamma and alpha and maximum of topics. If you specify max of topics say about 23 topics, then you model provide 23 topics in output. If you set up 15 topics then you get 15 topics in output. Yee Whye Teh et al\\'s 2005 paper Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes describes a nonparametric prior for grouped clustering problems. For example, the HDP helps in generalizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to the case the number of topics in the data is discovered by the inference algorithm instead of being specified as a parameter of the model. Detailed explanation on Dirichlet Process can be found here Topic models promise to help summarize and organize large archives of texts that cannot be easily analyzed by hand. The Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is a powerful mixed-membership model for the unsupervised analysis of grouped data. Unlike its finite counterpart, latent Dirichlet allocation, the HDP topic model infers the number of topics from the data. ',\n","  'gen:': \"HDP uses a matrix formula. HDP modeling procedures require data sets, and bind them to a set of equations. HDP classifies groups of cells based on their individual distribution. This is because HDP starts out as a single structure: a single gene. Because HDP classifies the numbers of groups of cells based on the distribution of these genes, it has a set of rules for how it groups them into groups. HDP also needs a weighting, and it can not just have a first group, it can have any grouping of cells (except the aforementioned group, which can only be first) as a null value. This makes a difference: HDP defines the distribution of the sub-groups of the groups, while HDP classifies each sub-group based on the distribution of the sub-groups themselves. When you are developing a subject model, you have to deal with the issue that you need to decide which particular class you want to put things into. HDP is much, much more consistent, so you can make a much more precise, precise, complete decision about which to put the topics into. But HDP is a statistical model, so you have to make as much accurate decision as possible about which sub-groups to put things in, while HDP is a fundamental physical property of the cells. Note that HDP is not the only method for making these decisions. As you mentioned, you can make up your own rules about which sub-groups to put things in, and this is how the methodology was developed when the Wikipedia page I linked above was written. So in both cases, the [Wikipedia page](_URL_1_) I wrote is pretty good for when I was really trying to make sense of the work, and it gives you some useful insight into what is going on in HDP where you don't know much about what's going on with other, more general-purpose models. tl;dr: HDP design isn't necessary, HDP does.

Now  the data set $(X_i,Z_i)$ defines a two-class boolean classification problem.  The solution to that boolean classification problem with highest accuracy solves your original problem (minimizes your loss function).  So, you are basically asking how to train a neural network to solve a two-class boolean classification problem.  A reasonable approach is to put a softmax layer at the output of the neural network and train it using the cross-entropy loss, as usual.  During test time, to pick a class, you pick whichever of the two classes has the higher likelihood output from the softmax stage.  In other words, at training time, you look at the actual outputs (continuous-valued) from the softmax layer and use the cross-entropy;  at test time, you compare the two outputs and pick whichever is larger to choose the classification (and apart from that ignore their exact values).  The shortcoming of this approach is that it doesn't take into account the value of the $Y_i$'s, only their sign.  To improve this, use weights on the samples.  We're again going to train a boolean classifier on the training set $(X_i,Z_i)$, but this time we'll weight each sample in the training set differently.  Put the weight $Y_i$ on the sample $(X_i,Z_i)$ in your training set.

Notice that errors in samples where $Y_i$ is large are penalized more, and errors in samples where $Y_i$ is small are penalized less;  this is appropriate, as that's exactly what will happen when you use the classifier $f_theta$ to compute $L(f_theta)$.

On a basic level, let\\'s say that you are trying to model how many molecules of ethanol are in the gas that\\'s left over after leaving the gas tank. You\\'ll want to know the **initial concentration**: it tells you how much ethanol there is in the gas. We can do this by using the proportion of water vapor left in the sample to its actual concentration. So, what is the initial concentration of water vapor in the sample? Lets say we started with the data set c. We would have the following values: X_1_c = k*_l_*k*_l_* > k*_l_*. If we wanted to find this concentration, we can take the Constant of 100. As for the transition, that\\'s the equation for a temperature transition. Once you know how much ethanol there is in the sample, you can start looking at the reverse step.

At the phase where we started with the initial value, we know the initial concentration to be C=100+5.6 In order to find that concentration, we have to plug that into the equation for the initial concentration.

I have a data set which corresponds to a coarse sampling of the function values $X$ at different time points, $t_1, t_2, ...$. I have a analytic-derived model for the derivative $frac{dX}{dt}$ = $F(X(t),G(t))$ which has a couple tunable parameters in the (known) functions $F$ and $G$. I've been able to tune these models with the following process:   Chose a set of parameters for the functions $F$ and $G$. Do a forward-Euler method from the earliest time in my data set to the ending point in my data set, generating the $X(t)$ which corresponds to the above parameters in $F$ and $G$. Use this $X(t)$, along with my measured data points to generate a model error. Use the above modeled error to go back to (1), iterating and doing an optimization over the parameters in the expression for $frac{dX}{dt}$ to minimize the error.   Note that in the above I have to deal with the function itself and not the derivative because my measured data is on a coarser time grid than the derivative needs to be computed. For example, my derivative changes meaningfully on a scale of $Delta t$, but my data set might only have points every $5Delta t$ to $10 Delta t$. I cannot take the function values themselves from the data set and create a derivative myself because of this discrepancy in the time scales.  Now this process works pretty well, and I'm able to achieve a pretty good error. However, I'm wondering if there's a better way to model the derivative $frac{dX}{dt}$ than this analytic model. For example, would a neural network or a regression tree be able to do a better job?  My question is, how would I do this in a computationally efficient way? Let's take a neural network as an example. I'm used to having inputs and their associated outputs when training a NN with standard packages. But the problem is, if I want to model the derivative, I don't have the derivative as an output to train on. I only know the function values and have only been able to compute a error to minimize on through the forward Euler integration. Of course I could treat the NN parameters as I did with the parameters above, and do a brute force minimization on them, but I obviously lose a lot of the efficiency of backprop in doing so (or, if I was doing this with a decision tree, would lose the logic of how regression trees are normally optimized).  Is there a better way for me to do this? Are there methods that exist to handle this problem?

Let me try and explain it to you as I understand it. As with a lot of controversial subjects there is some disagreement over whether or not methods of verifying a solution are secure or not, which limits your ability to make valid or logical inferences in other cases. I will give you a rough rundown as it's probably a lot easier to understand if we discuss the points. 1) There is no guarantee that an individual object can produce a value at any time at any value x. It would be possible to measure an object to be all a certain amount of x before the object can be tested in a way which would guarantee that it produces a value x at any given time. 2) Some test methods will obtain a value at a certain value x after the object is checked. There are lots of measures of measuring and eliminating false positives which allows this, but it is not guaranteed that the outcome will be secure. 3) The details of the method are not known for certain, but most likely the data points or the properties of the system are known. The systems can also be tested with sufficient accuracy, but the methods of determining if an object produces a certain value must be reviewed to determine if they are secure and safe. These tests are usually done in the absence of security data, but the results must be reproducible. The only way to guarantee that the test was secure and secure was to have the data points be determined somehow. This kind of testing may not yield a definitive guarantee, but has been used in the past. 4) The tools are not for determining truth. As such the methods of determining truth are only known for probability. But again, since you cannot have the system be both safe and secure, there is no guarantee that the testing methods are safe and secure. 5) There is no clear mechanism to test if a method of determining truth is secure or not. In many cases this is the case, but a standard method might be chosen where the results are reliably good but not in a secure manner. A good example is in the science of probability theory, where the methods of determining whether a method is reliable or not are described as sufficiently weighted and tested.\",\n","  'question:': 'Implementation of reliable rule learning I want to perform \"reliable rule learning\", i.e. mining a set of rules with a very low number of false negatives.

To explain this, I will first have to introduce the term state space. Recall that a Boltzmann machine is built out of binary units, i.e. every unit can be in one of two states - say 0 and 1. The overall state of the network is then specified by the state for every unit, i.e. the states of the network can be described as points in the space ${0,1}^N$, where N is the number of units in the network. This point is called the state space.  Now, on that state space, we can define a probability distribution. The details are not so important, but what you essentially do is that you define energy for every state and turn that into a probability distribution using a Boltzmann distribution. Thus there will be states that are likely and other states that are less likely.  A Gibbs sampler is now a procedure to produce a sample, i.e. a sequence $X_n$ of states such that, roughly speaking, the distribution of these states across the state space reflects the probability distribution. Thus you want most of the $X_n$ to be in regions of the state space with high probability (and low energy), and few of them to be in regions with low probability (and high energy).  To do this, a naive Gibbs sampling approach would proceed as follows. You start with some state $X_0$. To find the state $X_1$, you would pick some unit and calculate the conditional probability for that unit to be in state 1 (\"on\") conditional on the current value of all other units. Call this number p. You would then set the unit to 1 with probability p and pick the next unit to repeat this to get from $X_1$ to $X_2$ and so forth.  In the special case of a restricted Boltzmann machine, this can be greatly simplified. Instead of going through, say, first all hidden units and then all visible units and update them like this one by one, you can, in fact, update all hidden units in one step and all visible units in one step, because any two hidden units and any two visible units are independent. Thus, for a full cycle through all units of the state space, you would:   calculate the probability for all hidden units to be 1, given the value of the visible units set the hidden units to 1 with this probability calculate the probability for the visible units to be 1, again conditional on the value of the hidden units, and set the visible units to 1 with this probability   This constitutes one full Gibbs sampling step and is your step 1 + the first part of 3 (the second part is then needed for the further calculation and not part of the sampling). The reason why we do this in the CD algorithm is that we actually want to approximate an expectation value and use a sampler for this.  This is a complex topic and hard to summarize in a few sentences. If you want to learn more about the mathematics behind this (Markov chains) and on the application to RBMs (contrastive divergence and persistent contrastive divergence), you might find this and this document helpful - these are some notes that I put together while learning about this.

You've transferred from a standard 5-unit amount of weights to an experimental unit of weights. Let's look at the original lab development process. Have you already done the weights? That would have taken some time and it would be difficult. Not at all difficult, if you consider an equation like y=x+1. Well, you're performing that operation, too. You have one phase, a 'time' and a 'value' phase. A phase is the unit of length, it defines the range of positive and negative coordinates for you to pick up on your inputs. The unit of value is your output, and it defines the range of positive and negative coordinates for you to pick up on your inputs. The multiple of the one phase defines the amount of time a previous instance of this function occurred. You're now in the phase 3 phase. What do you do? That is, you take the function x^2 . If the function is positive, you know for sure that an input of x^2 will have a positive value. If it is negative, you can be pretty sure the input will have a negative value. But wait, now you've shifted the function to -1, so you now know for certain that an input of x^2 will have a negative value. What you do next is change the next dimension of x. The previously 1 in the phase 3 phase is now 2 in the phase 2 phase. What is the last phase? Well, you've transitioned to the last dimension. At this point, you take the function y^3. You're now in the phase 7 phase. We're in the phase 6 phase. You're a full positive- or negative- object. To see it again, consider this step: y = 5x + y+2 + y y = -1 How did you manage to shift it?

Then, the loss for some data set with actual classes $y = y_1, dots, y_n$ and predictions $hat{y} = hat{y}_1, dots, hat{y}_n$ can be defined as   $$ text{loss}(y, hat{y}) = frac{1}{mn} sum_{j=1}^nsum_{i=1}^m w_i {I}_{(y_j == i)}text{log}(hat{y}_j) $$  where ${I}_{(y_j == i)}$ is an indicator function which evaluates to 1 if $y_j == i$ and 0 otherwise.  One disadvantage is that it's not immediately obvious, given some value of the loss function, how good a particular value of the loss function is. However, it is easy to compare two values (lower is better). You have to use F1 score. A simple solution for that is to use confusion matrix. The way you can find F1 score for each class is simple. your true labels for each class can be considered as true predictions and the rest which are classified wrongly as the other classes should be added to specify the number of false predictions. For each class, you can find the F1 score. For more details take a look at F1-score per class for multi-class classification. You can take a look at this implementation. In https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896971831163X?via%3Dihub, we have used the product of the sensitivity of class i (i.e., the ratio of data correctly classified for class i) obtained for each class.

This gives you the choice of operand conditioning and operand conditioning parameters in order to eliminate the confusion with binary. For example, take a list of values from one variable and use them to evaluate a variable. You are doing this when you ask the question \"How many *different* values will the class {a,b,c,d} contain?\". If you only ask a single variable, it is likely to give a very specific answer, which is obviously sufficient to eliminate any confusion. If you use multiple variables then the error becomes more likely, because there is some way to calculate between these many different values. This way you avoid the problem that you need a method to eliminate two variables. You can also consider of case 3. Since you are calculating in a binary system, there are limits to the value you can compute within these limits, and what you can do is increase the values you can calculate, while requiring an intermediate program for some of the evaluations. This results in a standard set of values. You can then reduce the uncertainties, reducing the more common values. You can keep doing this until you have not come up with the error of only one variable. For instance, say I want to evaluate the size of the number of coins and the probability that coins will rise to the top. Since I only ask one variable and not many variables, I can also eliminate any problems. If I have 2 variables and 5 values, I have to solve the problem with only the minimum error. I can make it work out by multiplying both variables and dividing by the minimum error.

Is passing the coordinates of the food as state an other way of \"cheating\"?    Again it depends on what you expect the agent to learn from. If, in your target production environment, this data was easy to obtain, and you intended to use it to write a game bot working from the trained policy, then this is fine. There is no requirement that you do one thing or another if you have a practical problem to solve.  However, learning from a pixel-only state, as in the DQN original papers, is of academic interest, because that is a generic state representation that applies to many problems, whilst the distance from the snake to food is a specific feature that you have engineered that makes learning easier in a smaller set of games.  The main issue here is again that your goal is not really to put a \"snake bot\" into a production system, but to learn how RL works. RL is tricky, and often doesn\\'t work as well as you expect - or at all, for many combinations of algorithm and problem.   It is worth reading this article: Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn\\'t Work Yet - it may put disappointing results from basic DQN into perspective.  I would encourage you to strip back your Snake problem to remove \"helpful\" rewards and state, and instead look into extensions to the core DQN algorithm, or different learning agents such as A3C.

If the program knows that the data it has is false, then it will go into the wrong direction. This is an example of a \"how the program works\" problem, and is the basic principle of \"all-game theory\". This problem can be modeled with electrical (light) signals, called a \"photoelectric effect\". An example of a \"way the system works\" problem is this one: it assumes the activation \"receive\" - > will. The outcome is a **true/false** electrical signal, called an \"inverter\". Now, the operating system can turn this into neural networks by dictating how an error-correction function, called an \"inverse algorithm,\" functions. The problem is, the neural networks aren\\'t infinite. A human error can actually cause the function to have a very low error. When the error is very low, it might not even even affect the program that is executing it. Now, the reason that it\\'s very easy to correct the errors can be explained by a massive number of simple rules. One of the most common rules of inverse algorithms is, \"The inverse algorithm must be changed for every possible input.\" For example, suppose we have a line of five numbers, AAAAA, AAAAB, AACCC, and CCCC. And we want to perform a numerical operation called to \"take the sum of the three terms of that input.\" These are all possible inputs, so we should perform an inverse algorithm to take the sum of these inputs. However, we also need to change the inputs that we do take, to do a single operation. In general, for a simple inverse algorithm to function, we need to change at least one input, but not all three inputs -- we must modify the ratio of input number to input number for each input. So if the inverse algorithm fails to solve any of these problems, it could potentially cause the behavior of the program to go into reverse.',\n","  'question:': 'Boundaries of Reinforcement Learning I finally developed a Game Bot that learns how to play the videogame Snake with Deep Q-Learning. I tried with different neural networks and hyper-parameters, and I found a working set-up, for a specific set of rewards.  The problem is is: when I reward the agent for going in the right direction - positive rewards in case the coordinates of the agent increase or decrease accordingly to the coordinates of the food - the agent learns pretty fast, obtaining really high scores. When I don\\'t reward the agent for that, but only negative rewards for dying and positive for eating the food, the agent does not learn.

Then you can experiment with different clustering algorithms and see what works.   What comes to mind is dynamic time warping (DTW). DTW gives you a way to find a measure of \"distance\" (it is actually not strictly a distance metric, but it is close) between two time series. One very useful thing is that it can be used to compare two time series that are of different lengths.   There are many good blog posts on DTW, so I won\\'t try to give yet another explanation of it. There are also many python implementations of it. And a lot of work has gone into making the algorithm very fast. DTW is a strange algorithm--in some ways very simplistic, but typically works well. Once you modify the algorithm to deal with paths, you can construct the distance matrix and use that for clustering. One common clustering algorithm that is used in conjunction with DTW is spectral clustering, since the distance matrix can be used directly (instead of the matrix of data points, which we don\\'t have here). ',\n","  'gen:': \"Just remember that we're talking about datasets with vectors so there are a lot of different ways to make things like that. For example, one algorithm might be to calculate the sum of successive nodes (called convergent loops). Each time the math is done, it introduces a certain sum of these loops which then gets multiplied together. Another algorithm might be to just draw a big line around the function and after counting each number of nodes, you'll get a nice circle, like the radius of a pizza. For other types of data, you'll need to do different tricks. But each more complex algorithm will require slightly more memory to deal with - and on top of that, the longer the path, the more memory it needs. However, your main goal, especially when you're linking data is to be consistent. You should make the math work, since the loops are going to change over time. As far as I know, any network method can allow for path-finding randomness. For example, with a low-resolution image like [this](_URL_0_), the vectors are all random, but the network construction algorithm (which tells the system which vectors to check for which areas of the data) can do things like count how many vectors are in each area to see if the area is changing - but for the vectors that you're linking to, it just checks whether the loop changes as much as the others are shifting. Finally, the network structure algorithm (which gives you the path length and then instructs the network structure algorithm where to send the data) can be broken down into, say, a series of path interceptor loops, and the network construction algorithm will figure out the allocation of these paths based on the data. For non-technical data (kind of like objects that don't change size or position much), you might end up with a system like [this](_URL_1_). For example, there's a mathematical algorithm that finds the path you're going to take with your destination. There's an algorithm that finds the path for you to take with your destination. There's another algorithm that finds the path of all of them.\",\n","  'question:': \"What clustering algorithm is appropriate for clustering paths?

Also, the Further Considerations section, I think, explains what the various components represent and addresses your questions.  A short summary of what those sections describe is that the original components (i.e., axes) of the data do not properly represent the relationship inherit in the data. Instead, the components can be combined to yield a new set of components, or axes, that better describe how the data is distributed.  The wiki link states that \"PCA can be thought of as fitting an n-dimensional ellipsoid to the data\". In that line of thinking, the output of PCA is the eigenvectors and eigenvalues that define the orientation and length of the ellipsoid that best fits the data.   What you do with that ellipsoid is up to you and your application of PCA. I agree with dpmcmlxxvi\\'s answer that the common \"output\" of PCA is computing and finding the eigenvectors for the principal components and the eigenvalues for the variances, but I can\\'t add comments yet and would still like to contribute.   Once you hit this step of calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the principal components, you can do many types of analyses depending on your needs.  I believe the \"output\" you are specifically asking about in your question is the resultant data set of applying a transformation or projection of the original data set into the desired linear subspace (of n-dimensions). This is taking the output of PCA and applying it on your original data set.   This PCA step by step example may help. The ultimate output of this 6 step analysis was the projection of a 3 dimensional data set into 2 dimensions. Here are the high level steps:        Taking the whole dataset ignoring the class labels   Compute the d-dimensional mean vector   Computing the scatter matrix (alternatively, the covariance matrix)   Computing eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues   Ranking and choosing k eigenvectors   Transforming the samples onto the new subspace      Ultimately, step 4 is the \"output\" since that is where the common requirements for performing PCA are fulfilled. We can make different decisions at steps 5 and 6 and produce alternative output there.    A few more possibilities:   You could decide to project the observations with outliers removed Another possible outcome here would be to calculate the proportion of variance explained by one or any combination of principal components. For example, the proportion of variance explained by the first two principal components of K components is (1+2)/(1+2+. . .+K). After plotting the projected observations into the first two principal components (as in the given example), you can impose a plot of the loadings of each of the original dimensions into the subspace (scaled by the standard deviation of the principal components). This way, we can see the contribution of the original dimensions (in your case a - e) to principal component 1 and 2. The biplot is another common product of PCA.  ',\n","  'gen:': \"d levels. There's one component which would be the % figure(s), and the other(s), so these could be done along the three dimensions model. The second component would be the % value(s), where these would be done along the second dimension. The .inf currently represents the ratios between the magnitude of the original mass and the corresponding volume. For example, if you have a pointer to a space which defines a particle as that position (this may change based on what you are looking at), it has a .inf of .5 to .10. So if you have that in a 2 dimensional space, with a volume of .5, then a .inf would be .5. An .inf notation only takes the length and time of a line. The .isc notation would be the line length(s) and the time(s) in your image. If you have a line length of .1cm, then the .inf notation would be .5cm. If you have a line length 1cm, then the .ac would be 1mm. So there's one variable quantity which describes a set of data. The .inf scale is another variable quantity. The .ac notation is another. The .y and # are the third components of the .ac, and they describe the logarithmic data structure. The .biz notation would be the sum of the third and the fourth components. This is my interpretation of the problem because I'm not really sure how it works in reality. And in this sense I may be wrong. I'm just trying to try and make sense of how it works out for how long a domain will stay if you check for one. No one knows yet. I also apologize if any of the details make any sense and I just thought it would be easier to explain in a way I could understand. I hope this helped. Edit: Someone probably pointed out that in some cases the .octet length rule doesn't work correctly, so you could use the .bscript value instead.

I'm trying to understand PCA, but I don't have a machine learning background.  I come from software engineering, but the literature I've tried to read so far is hard for me to digest.

How can we share the weight of each sensor when I only rotate it 90 degrees? Well, for me, I'm more than equal to the amount of information needed to compute the exact position of each sensor. It's sort of like the hours of work needed to compute it. It's called Time-Division Multiplication. As the cube moves more the time-division multiplies by 4, but for the example that's for the camera because it's only the amount of information you have to ask for. The more pieces of information you're able to ask for, the longer your time-division (because you can get less information per unit time-division). As a more basic example, a 256x40 in 3D (10 million pieces of data) gives you 23 hours of time-division time. Now lets skip about 10 hours of time-division. Lets say you have a 20x20/3D object you want to look at. That object has red, green, and blue. I want to know how far you want to rotate the object to look at each. If I move the object to the right, the 3D object is still going to be red, green, and blue. I need to rotate the object so it's looking at the blue one as well. So I have two options: either I rotate it twice and move it to the right, or I rotate the object to the right twice and rotate it to the left. If I rotate it to the right twice, then each of those 3 options gives me one second of time-division and will give me 2,073 seconds of time-division data. I need to rotate it to the right twice, and the 2x1 object will be 8 hours of time-division data. If I rotate it to the right twice and move it to the left, then each of those options gives me three seconds of time-division data.

My question is about the structure of the network required to solve my problem with fewer data.  I have a sensor device that simply reports the color of the thing it's seeing in front of it. One sensor reports me 4 numbers: Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha.  The intensity of the color changes depends on the distance and the thing it's seeing. I have 6 such sensors attached on each side of a small cube. The cube can be moved and rotated using the hand.  I want to predict the position of the cube in space in real-time.  My problem:  Input: 6 identical sensors, each giving 4 numbers. Total=6*4=24 numbers.  Output: 3 numbers, X, Y, Z, (Position of the cube)  I have my data ready with label XYZ.  Now, train a simple Multi-layer perceptron which takes 24 numbers and output 3 numbers. This is working quite fine but it needs hell lots of data in a cubic meter space to predict accurately.  The problem is about the rotation. I need to rotate and cover 360 degrees for every location for it to predict well.  But I know for the fact that each sensor is identical so I want to share the weight of each sensor. I know that when you rotate the cube 90 degrees, it should not affect the output position at all. So this should mean the order of the sensors is not important. This means I should somehow use add or average to merge my sensors' layer. If I use concatenate it will preserve the order which make the output position changes.  The way I'm doing it is that I feed 4 numbers into a sensor model that are shared among all sensors, get the encoding, add them up, then connect it to Dense layers. Following is the model prototype:  from keras.layers import Input, Dense from keras.models import Model, Sequential  sensor1 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor2 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor3 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor4 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor5 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor6 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor_model = Sequential([     Dense(64, activation='relu'),     Dense(64, activation='relu'), ]) sensor1_encoding = sensor_model(sensor1) sensor2_encoding = sensor_model(sensor2) sensor3_encoding = sensor_model(sensor3) sensor4_encoding = sensor_model(sensor4) sensor5_encoding = sensor_model(sensor5) sensor6_encoding = sensor_model(sensor6) sensor_encoding = average([     sensor1_encoding,     sensor2_encoding,     sensor3_encoding,     sensor4_encoding,     sensor5_encoding,     sensor6_encoding, ]) h = sensor_encoding h = Dense(128, activation='relu')(h) h = Dense(128, activation='relu')(h) h = Dense(3, activation='linear') model = Model(inputs=[sensor1, sensor2, sensor3, sensor4, sensor5, sensor6], outputs=[h])   Right now, when I change the average function to concatenate, the model loss is lower on both training and validation set which contradicts with my intuition.

Otherwise your data should be in a different format, which will have more information in it, such as context for example. One way to'predict'correct words based on incorrect words is constructing a LM ( Language Model ) for each ( correct and incorrect ) and based on probabilities returning the ones with maximal likelihood, like a basic translation model. But this will only make sense if you have a lot of text ( not unigrams ) and each word appears several times, otherwise you don't really have a way to construct the LMs. The task that you are trying to do is really difficult to accomplish using machine learning as there is no pattern in how the corrected words are produced from incorrect words.

For example, if you have insurance claims with binary attributes ( \" poor driving record \", \" premium paid in cash \" ) you can compare claims with those attributes.

'},\n"," '11117': {'actual:': \"I couldn't find any useful literature out there for using deep learning for this specific problem. Most methods seem to rely on non - machine learning methods like string similarities and Levenstein distances. A reasonable deep learning based approach to this problem would be a Recurrent Neural Network. An LSTM ( Long short term memory ) or GRU ( Gated Recurrent Unit ) would be ideal. The idea is to have an RNN which has an internal state and respects the order in which the inputs are fed. Unlike text classification, sentiment analysis or sequence generation, the preferred encoding for the text here would be at a character level instead of word level. For example Christian Douglas, Chris, 1 Jhon Stevens, Charlie, 0 would become [ C, h, r, i, s, t, i, a, n,, D, o, u, g, l, a, s,, C, h, r, i, s ] - - [ 1 ] [ J, h, o, n,, S, t, e, v, e, n, s,, C, h, a, r, l, i, e ] - - [ 0 ] The two strings to be matched are concatenated into a single sequence. The intuition here is that the RNN would process the sequence character by character and learn ( read update weights ) that the characters at the end have a similar pattern to what it saw earlier in the same sequence to deduce that it should be a 1 instead of 0. The vector of [ 1 / 0 ] is the target variable. The standard RNN pre - processing steps apply as usual - we'll pad the sequences in the beginning so that they're all the same length ( say 50 ), the characters would be encoded as numeric instead of string etc. Since the dictionary here is pretty small ( 26 alphabets + space + pad ), the network architecture can be a fairly simple one. A single embedding layer + recurrent layer should suffice. Framing the problem in this manner allows us to use a vanilla RNN or an out - of - the - box LSTM / GRU instead of creating a custom architecture that takes two separate strings as input for each data point and throws out a number. You could give this approach a shot and see if is able to satisfactorily beats baseline models. A good reading for character level RNNs is Andrej Karpathy's blog and code. The problem he's trying to solve is different and the code is in pure numpy but it still captures the idea pretty well. I had a similar problem in my last job. My solution was to build features via ( transformation ( s ) + comparison ) * many combos and feed to models, then aggregate and model, i. e. 2 layer model. The key is encoding and similarity scores as features. Transforms : remove vowels ( great for certain roots ), remove end vowels, remove double characters, convert to phonetic string ( IPA, soundex, https : / / pypi. org / project / Fuzzy / ), replace characters that either sound similar or have different sounds in other languages ( $ J $ in East Europe sounds like $ Y $ in US, $ C $ can sound like $ K, D ~ T, Tsim TH $, etc ),... The strategy is to handle lots of weirdness / irregularity in people's names. Comparisons ( similarity and difference ) : try [ character level, block / root / [ pre / suf ] fix level, word level ( may not apply to you ) ] similarity and difference scores. Try Dice's coefficient, Levenshtein, NeedlemanWunsch, Longest common ( non ) contiguous substring, character histogram similarity, # characters matching, not matching ( each left and right ), etc. You could try using an RNN / LSTM and have it learn similarity for each transform. Use the output of the trained model ( s ) as another feature. Experiment with different combos of the above and select a few that seem to have value. You could simply take all the scores and fit with Logistic Regression ( or Neural Net ) or you could build statistical models and output percent rank based on a small training set to normalize it. Another way to preprocess the raw scores is to use calibration encoding via logistic function. Then add summary stats from the normalized scores as additional features. Push all this into the final model. Will you handle names that are derived from Arabic, Spanish, French, etc names? This is just extra, but consider downloading the Social Security and US Census name stats data to enhance your project with more name variations. I'll leave the how to you, but it helps knowing about the likely possibilities. Be aware that simply using Levenshtein doesn't work so well with William - > Bill, Dianne - > Di, Larry - > Lawrence, Mohammed - > Muhamed and Hamed, Danielle - > Daniela, Thomas - > Tom, and Jimmy - > James. The strategy I mentioned should help you with all the variation. Additional resources to explore : https : / / github. com / jamesturk / jellyfish https : / / nameberry. com / list / 276 / If - You - Like - Danielle - You - Might - Love https : / / pypi. org / project / phonetics / I would use some normalization as preprocessing, such as : Jr converted into Junior. Convert the name into Soundex as ldmtwo said And then use string algorithms instead of ML for this, such as Z algorithm, KMP algorithm, or Levenshtein distance, and then use threshold on the score.

In simple words, the number of LSTM units which will be used. units : Positive integer, dimensionality of the output space. Units are nothing but the LSTM cells which will be used to process the inputs. stateful : According to the docs : stateful : Boolean ( default False ). If True, the last state for each sample at index i in a batch will be used as initial state for the sample of index i in the following batch. If this argument is set to False then, the states or the memory of the LSTM cell will get reset at every sample which is passed through it. It follows this manner : Take a sample from the batch. The sample will pass through the LSTM and produce a state vector ( conditional memory ). The output is given If stateful = True then, the state vector will be used as the initial state for the 2nd sample. If stateful = False then, a new state vector will be used for the 2nd sample. Hence, the memory should migrate from one sample to another is decided by the stateful argument. unroll : According to the docs, unroll : Boolean ( default False ). If True, the network will be unrolled, else a symbolic loop will be used. Unrolling can speed - up a RNN, although it tends to be more memory - intensive. Unrolling is only suitable for short sequences. It can thought as : RNNs, once unfolded in time, can be seen as very deep feedforward networks in which all the layers share the same weights. ( Deep Learning, Nature, 2015 ) You can read an excellent article here. The unrolling will the make the LSTM, a deep feed forward network which has shared weights.

That being the worst case. Imagine that : $ loc in { } N $ is the first separation, so it's divided into Yes / No. Then $ loc in { } S $ is divided into Yes / No. Then $ loc in { } E $ is the third partition and the answer is the same ( Yes / No ), you have 8 ( 2 ^ 3 ) questions asked. There are many combinations of use / no use / which to combine in which step, etc, but ultimately you will be asking the tree to consider all possibilities, which are $ 2 ^ { card ( S ) } $. The author is referring to the number of possible splits of the given node, by the given feature during the building of the tree. The tree can send any subset of the levels to the left, and the remaining levels to the right. ( Well, actually the left / right symmetry means the number of options is cut in half, and there's no point in sending the empty set vs. the full set, so the real number of choices is $ 2 ^ { | S | - 1 } - 1 $, but the point remains that categorical variables with many levels are problematic. ) Compare to a continuous or ordinal variable, where the sort of splits we consider are only $ xleqalpha $ vs. $ x alpha $, and $ alpha $ need only range over the number of levels $ | S | - 1 $ ( again $ - 1 $ to ignore sending nothing vs. everything ).

Only by running an experiment would you get the actual answer, and not even then, given the loose definition of the formulations \" integrate more information \" and \" change a lot \" in your questions. First let\\'s understand why the format is like this. BERT was pretrained using the format [CLS] sen A [SEP] sen B [SEP]. It is necessary for the Next Sentence Prediction task : determining if sen B is a random sentence with no links with A or not. The [SEP] in the middle is here to help the model understand which token belong to which sentence. At finetuning time, if you use a different format than pretraining format, you might confuse the model : he never saw 2 sentences formatted as [CLS] Sen A Sen B [SEP]. The model doesn\\'t know there is 2 sentences, and will consider it as a single sentence. If you finetune on enough data, BERT can learn the new format. This can be helpful if you need to change the input format. But in your case, you don\\'t need to do this. Changing the format for the sake of changing the format is just going to confuse your model, he will have to learn more thing, and there will be inconsistencies between pretraining and finetuning. Will the s1 in second one integrate more information from s2 than the s1 in first one does? No. Inserting a SEP token or not will not change the amount of information exchange between the tokens of the 2 sentences. In both case the model will compute attention based on the 2 sentences. Each sentence can see the other sentence\\'s tokens, no matter of the SEP. The only thing you will do by removing the SEP token is confuse your model. Will the token embeddings change a lot between the 2 methods? We don\\'t know. It will definitely change, but how much? We cannot answer. My guess is that token representations will not change a lot ( because tokens are the same ), but CLS representation will change a lot ( instead of representing the links between 2 sentences, it will represent something else ).

This is a core tenant of Measure Theory. Regression measures outcome variables on ratio, interval, or ordinal scales. Classification measures outcome variables on nominal scales. You can always go from more complex scales ( i. e., ratio, interval, or ordinal ) to simpler scales ( i. e., nominal ). There are no guarantees about going back. This is technically called a non - injective mapping. One way to think of it is that you are picking a downsampling scheme to map the data from regression to classification, and there are many possible mappings back from classification to regression. There are no guarantees on which mapping was used. Once downsampled, the data has to stay in the lower sampling space.

If I repeat the code above using:  data_dir = \\'../input\\'     for file in os.listdir(data_dir):     print(file)   Then, it works correctly, it outputs the folder \"train\", the file \"train.csv\", the file \"sample_submission.csv\" and the folder \"test\" correctly.

That means there is current Level. And Level in the past. And the history of Level change in time for each Rider. The problem you are trying to solve is time dependant. Your source data can look like : 2 ) Build a variable to predict Second. You should build the target feature. This Rider Level ( Class ). As far as I understood : the overall rider'level'can be a function of his'classes'in each particular race types and... the race'observation'class is a kind of function of { Category, Race Type, Parcours, Distance, Position } So the only thing you realy need to predict is race result.

where I could define a set of rows with their attributes, and a class belonging to that set of rows, instead of having the typical model one observation - one class.  What I\\'m trying to do is to create a model which should be able to predict the future level of a rider in professional cycling - more likely to be used to forecast young riders\\' level . The input data are the results of each rider (race,category of race, type of parcours, position, and so on). The class is represented with the value (from 1 to 10) each \"known\" rider has been assigned for each skill (mountain, flat, time trial, sprint, etc.), which means that in principle, I would make one predictive model for each skill (what means for each class). For example, for mountain class I would have the following:  Rider   Category    Race Type   Parcours    Distance    Position    Class(Mountain) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Froome  GrandTour   Stage       Mountain    185         1           10 Froome  WorldTour   Stage       MidMountain 210         25          10 Nibali  Contin.Tour Stage       Mountain    170         15          9 Nibali  WorldTour   Classic     MidMountain 245         3           9   I see here two main challenges, apart from the fact of dealing with both numerical and categorical attributes.   A rider gathers a lot of results, and each of them will result in the same class value. For example, a victory in a Grand Tour category stage from Chris Froome would be rated with a 10 in mountain, but he would also be rated with a 10 in mountain when he ended up in a bad position in a lower level stage - just as in the example. Ok, it\\'s supposed that with thousands of rows the model (regression model probably, rather than a classification algorithm, but not sure of that either) should be able to detect the \"common\" pattern (a good performance in mountain from a good climber like Froome), so it could be overcome. I guess it\\'d be a matter of testing and finding the best-fitted models. I find the predictive part the most problematic one, because what I need isn\\'t to predict the class value for each observation (which is represented by each result), but the class value for each rider. That\\'s why I said at the beginning of the thread that I would need to somehow treat all the results of a rider as a unique observation (something like a set or group of observations), and assign the class value to that set. A workaround could be to take all the observations of the rider, predict the class for each of them, and then calculate the average, but it doesn\\'t look very smart.   So, any idea of how to build this kind of models?  Thanks in advance. '},\n"," '12323': {'actual:': \"You could take an Information Theory approach by finding the lowest KullbackLeibler divergence between the distributions. There is a KL divergence option within SciPy's entropy function. from scipy. stats import entropy p = [ 0. 21, 0. 24, 0. 36, 0. 56, 0. 67, 0. 72, 0. 74, 0. 83, 0. 84, 0. 87 ] # Data removed to make equal sizes : [ 0. 91, 0. 94, 0. 97 ] q _ 1 = [ 0. 13, 0. 21, 0. 27, 0. 34, 0. 36, 0. 45, 0. 49, 0. 65, 0. 66, 0. 90 ] print ( entropy ( p, q _ 1 ) ) 0. 019822015024454846 q _ 2 = [ 0. 14, 0. 18, 0. 19, 0. 33, 0. 45, 0. 47, 0. 55, 0. 75, 0. 78, 0. 82 ] print ( entropy ( p, q _ 2 ) ) 0. 01737229446663193 The second simulated distribution is closer than the first simulated distribution to the real distribution. If you are interested in inference, you could run many simulations and compute p - values. That process is a variation of permutation testing. As we should not remove any data... we can use vector norm from the origin ( l2 norm ) given that data _ a, data _ b, data _ c are arrays. import numpy as np import pandas as pd from numpy. linalg import norm l2 _ a = norm ( data _ a ) l2 _ b = norm ( data _ b ) l2 _ c = norm ( data _ c ) print ( l2 _ a, l2 _ b, l2 _ c ) output : 2. 619885493680974 1. 5779100101083077 1. 6631897065578538. as l2 _ a, l2 _ c values are closer, data _ a and data _ c are close to each other. Consider using the Earth Mover's Distance ( i. e., the Wasserstein - 1 distance ), which ( similar to the KL - divergence ) can be used to compute the distance between sets of points ( or rather the empirical distribution induced by them ). There is a method in scipy for it, as well as this library. Advantages : You don't need to have the same number of points in each set ( the EMD allows splitting mass ). An advantage over the KL - divergence is that the KLD can be undefined or infinite if the distributions don't have identical support ( though using the Jensen - Shannon divergence mitigates this ). Further, estimating entropies is often hard and not parameter - free ( usually requiring binning or KDE ), while one can solve EMD optimizations directly on the input data points. An advantage over simple statistics ( e. g., comparing means and covariances, or norms ) is that they tend to lose information. E. g., matching the first two moments does not force the third moment to match ; or, two datasets can have the same norm despite being very different ( for $ n $ points, every point on the $ n $ - hyper - sphere of the same radius has identical norm ). In contrast, the EMD must consider the relation of every point in one set to every point in the other. I consider using the KS test perfectly reasonable. See also this post. One caveat is that its use of the supremum is a little extreme. For instance, one distribution has a large CDF deviation $ delta $ at some point and is very close the rest of the time vs another that deviates by $ delta - epsilon $ for some tiny $ epsilon $ many times - the KS statistic will prefer the former. It is up to you whether that makes sense.

I have the following three datasets. data_a=[0.21,0.24,0.36,0.56,0.67,0.72,0.74,0.83,0.84,0.87,0.91,0.94,0.97] data_b=[0.13,0.21,0.27,0.34,0.36,0.45,0.49,0.65,0.66,0.90] data_c=[0.14,0.18,0.19,0.33,0.45,0.47,0.55,0.75,0.78,0.82]  data_a is real data and the other two are the simulated ones. Here I am trying to check which one (data_b or data_c) is closest or closely resembles to data_a. Currently I am doing it visually and with ks_2samp test (python). Visually I graphed the cdf of real data vs cdf of simulated data and try to see visually that which one is the closest.  Above is the cdf of data_a vs cdf of data_b  Above is the cdf of data_a vs cdf of data_c So by visually seeing it one might can say that data_c is more closer to data_a then data_b but it is still not accurate. Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test Second method is the KS-test where I tested data_a with data_b as well as data_a with data_c.     stats.ks_2samp(data_a,data_b) Ks_2sampResult(statistic=0.5923076923076923, pvalue=0.02134674813035231)     stats.ks_2samp(data_a,data_c) Ks_2sampResult(statistic=0.4692307692307692, pvalue=0.11575018162481227)  From above we can see that statistic is lower in when we tested data_a with data_c so data_c should be closer data_a than data_b. I didn't consider the pvalue as it would not be appropriate to think of it as a hypotheses test and use the p-value obtained because the test is designed with the null hypothesis predetermined. So my question here is that if I am doing this correctly and also is there any other better way to do it? Thank You \"},\n"," '12415': {'actual:': \"Yes, Cosine TF - IDF is quite transparent so it's usually reasonably easy to visualize the words which contribute the most to a score. Cosine is defined as the dot product divided by the product of the norms, so you can isolate the terms : dotproduct ( d _ 1, d _ 2 ) = tfidf ( w1, d1 ) * tfidf ( w1, d2 ) + tfidf ( w2, d1 ) * tfidf ( w2, d2 ) +... + tfidf ( wN, dN ) Ranking the words w _ i by descending order of the term tfidf ( w _ i, d1 ) * tfidf ( w _ i, d2 ) gives the top most contributing words for the similarity score. Mind that if the documents have big differences in size, this will have an effect since cosine is normalized with their norms.

But if you have a large enough dataset you can actually use MLP based classifier try some basuc feature selection techniques such as RFECV or feature _ importanece _ function you can use contained in every model after you train it. And if at the end of the day you are still confused to which model to use i would suggest use all of them stack them and you will have something better. Making these decisions solely on the basis of statistics is tough because statistics puts everything into an abstract form that is a whole dataset being represented by 1 number thus it is always prone to certain errors thus i always prefer to combine my data science experiments with my statistical results and then only conclude about my results. Also while using statistical analysis a lot of things depend on your dataset i. e. is it big enough to draw meaningful conclusions out of it what might be the sampling error and many more things.

the resampled paired t test and the k-fold cross-validated paired t test\"  .  I am currently making some experiments with an unbalanced data set, which I balanced using SCUT and trained a set of different classifiers. The problem is a multiclass with three different classes to choose. I am applying a Multilayer Perceptron, a Decision Tree and a Random Forest and the results, after a 10-fold cross validation, are the following:  Multilayer Perceptron: 0.95 acc  Decision Tree: 0.93 acc  Random Forest: 0.935 acc  When I apply the 5x2cv t test I got the following results:  MLP and DT:  t-statistic 4.75  p-value 0.005  So, if I assume that for the tests I will have a value of alpha of 0.05 for rejecting the null hypothesis, which is that both algorithms perform well with the same database, then from the p-value I got I could reject the null hypothesis. This would mean that both models do not perform equally well, so it would be better to use MLP over the DT because of its higher accuracy.  When I do the same with the MLP and the RF I got the following results:  t-statistic: 2.46  p-value: 0.055  Here, I suppose that I can conclude that using MLP or RF for the current dataset is almost the same, because I failed to reject the null hypothesis. The question that I have here is if should I choose the RF even though the accuracy was lower?  The comparison with the DT and RF has the following values:  t-statistic: -2.49  p-value: 0.054  So I can reject the null hypothesis and said that there is difference between the use of the DT over the RF.  Are my conclusions correct?  Thanks '},\n"," '1340': {'actual:': 'There are ranking algorithms based on machine learning that are aimed to build ranking models.

evaluating both models ( regressors and featureth ). the names of the test data are chosen to be split into training / validation sets ( exactly ). an alternative to the choice of \" pure \" dataset is the objective of just cross - validation sets. when discussing success for the same number of folds, you test your model on the test dataset ( validation ). this can be really good enough to identify if the specific needs to be adhere to produce a unique validation set and use the results from a given feature set for validation set. in this case, you want to have a train and test set which allows you to do sampling the different finds common appropriate cross validation result to select the best performing model. using it on a separate validation set, you re indeed need to adjust the values of features ( grep, i = 1 : test ( x - event ) parts - - old ) / train / test ( test ( provide you with training set ) ), test - parameters ( validation set, parameters ) and then select

'question:': 'making predictions from detrended data I am building a machine learning based model (random forest in scikit-learn) to predict maize yields in the U.S. based on data on historical maize yields and temperature and precipitation information. Since there is a trend in maize yields, I detrend the yield data first, then fit the model and then predict for current year. However, I assume that the predictions from the model are detrended as well. How do I go about making predictions that are not detrended? Any pointers and literature reference would be helpful '},\n"," '13525': {'actual:': 'Generally, that number of genes should be reduced to much smaller set of meaningful features. Then, the reduced feature set can be used in the model. For example, Principal Component Analysis ( PCA ) is one of the most common reduction techniques and has been used for gene expression data. \" Machine learning for integrating data in biology and medicine : Principles, practice, and opportunities \" by Zitnika et al. covers a variety of feature engineering techniques for genes. Yes, using one - hot encoding on 24k features requires 24k input nodes. However this should not be a problem for Keras ( or any other deep learning library ). Natural language processing often uses one - hot encoding on words with a vocabulary size in the same ballpark. If you are using a \" deep \" model, one of your hidden layers should take care of reducing the dimensionality of your data. A separate pre - processing step is usually not needed. The training time should not be unreasonable. Entity Embedding for Categorical Variables ( original pager ) would be a very suitable approach here. Read on here, or here. I have actually put pieces of codes from here and there and made an complete running implementation, see this git repo. This easily handles very high cardinal categorical variables using neural networks. I won\\'t list pros and cons of OHE, you just Google it, but one of its main drawbacks esp. when having a very high cardinal categorical variable is it increasing drastically your feature space unnecessarily, which in my opinion isn\\'t ideal. And more importantly OHE, to my knowledge, doesn\\'t account for semantic relationship between categories if exists such a relation! However, Entity Embedding is a concept to Word Embedding in NLP, the weights that are being learned to encode the categories can potentially capture intra - category relations.

I'm currently working on a logistic regression model for genomics. One of the input fields I want to include as a covariate is genes. There are around 24,000 known genes. There are many features with this level of variability in computational biology and hundreds of thousands of samples are needed.   If I LabelEncoder() those 24K genes and then OneHotEncoder() them ...   Is 24,000 columns going to make my keras training times unreasonable for a 2.2 GHz quad-core i7 CPU?   If so, is there a different approach to encoding that I can take with this?  Should I somehow try to dedicate a layer of my model to this feature?  Does this mean I need 24K input nodes? \"},\n"," '13560': {'actual:': 'As always in ML modelling problems : it depends. The critical factor here is that you are predicting based on properties of a sequence. The sequence does not need to be sampled at fixed time steps, or even be time based at all. E. g. in natural language processing the sequence of letters or words is only very loosely associated with the timing of the same items when spoken or read. The sequence does need to be drawn from a self - consistent source where moving from one item to next item in the sequence has the same meaning with respect to what you are trying to predict. If the interruptions you see would cause large differences in the expected distribution of your input vector X or output Y, then you may not be able to use them as - is. You may still be able to rescue them as input data for a RNN, and make predictions based on them, if you add whether or not there has been an interruption - and if it might be relevant to your purpose, for how long - as additional features of input items in X. Another option is to follow the time sequence strictly but add placeholder value of X ( with a different flag set ) for \" unkown \", maybe along with some rough guess for the missing features ( or even a ML prediction from a different model ), which you might do if the quantity being aggregated over is still active and important where there are missing records, but the aggregation service you are using as input has failed. Depending on how much data you have available, and whether you need to make predictions at times when your aggregation service has failed, you could do anything from discarding incomplete data to ignoring the time differences, to interpolating missing records. The first question you need to answer is \" what does it mean for a sequence item to be missing \" : If the whole system that provided the aggregation data is switched off, and there is no concept of pending items that will enter the system the moment it is switched on, then you can probably safely ignore the missing records and ignore the precise timing. If your prediction target is sensitive to elapsed time, and yo uneed to make predictions even when there have been interruptions to the aggregation system, then you will want to augment the sequence data somehow to account for the missing records, and train / predict with that added feature engineering. If only the aggregation is switched off ( or has a chance of failure causing gaps in the record ), and you don\\'t need to run any predictions when it is not available, then you may be able to make the rule that the prediction system will only function when there are 6 recent consecutive records available, and discard the data that is causing you to worry. This makes sense if interruptions are rare or the predictive model is not critical. If you are not sure which of these things to do, then the next approach is to do all of them that seem that they could be intuitively correct, tuning each model separately, then see how each different approach performs on your test set.

I have a recurrent neural network with LSTM units that I want to train with batches of 6 timesteps. Each timestep is a record of a dataset and represents the temporal aggregation over 5 minutes of data taken every 10 seconds. Unfortunately, the dataset has temporal interruptions, so sometimes two successive records in the dataset can be temporally separated by 10 minutes to a few weeks. I was wondering if the timesteps I give to the network in each batch must all be separated by the same temporal distance, that is in my case they must all be within 5 minutes of each other or it is sufficient that they are subsequent and therefore I could also give the network for example a batch with 4 records at a distance of 5 minutes from each other and then 2 taken for example two days later.  UPDATED: The data comes from an electronic system so the time interruptions are due to the device being turned off. Rarely it is turned off only for a few minutes while most of the time it remains off for longer periods, like hours or sometimes days. Among other elements, the device includes a battery, therefore many of the features present in the dataset records are temperature, current and voltage readings which change value during temporal interruptions (little when turned off for a few minutes and significantly when turned off for hours or days). The goal of the network is to predict the value of some features two steps ahead. '},\n"," '13732': {'actual:': 'Yes! This could be an excellent test case for your classification algorithm. With only 5 % mislabeling a good algorithm will be easily able to identify \" outliers \" by having much worse predictions for these mislabeled records. If you were able to at least identify \" correct \" records to generate a training set that would be even better but with 5 % mislabeling even if not it won\\'t be a problem. This also leads to the second part of the answer, that while it might be better to remove or correct the mislabeled records it might also not matter. This is obviously based on the assumption that the 5 % errors are somewhat randomly distributed over all classes. Finally, you did not mention any hints / data / info that could identify mislabels. Obviously if you have information about those errors doing some pre - processing to identify and remove them based on analysis / rules generation would be best.

values $ v ( 0, 1 ) $. the training could be being trained with a user across all categories, locations in a shorter section of model architecture. this pre - trained feature vectors can be extracted from any classifiers than can be used to play around with physical fields of handling let's say, in the feature extracting millions of records from input images, then predict the person who made part of a single image and achieve a feature extractor. this is done by adding 32 millions of pixels of video frames ( and this is one of the each pixel is a feature ). when a new image is presented, it is only available to another person. this is youtube 20 features for feature vectors. this image of features can be extracted from images, if you are interested in producing features like open dividing the audio image to 2d, you can represent that unet or uous tagger, and then use the same pre - processing strategy to extract the image to various userinv areas of text, hierarchical and unsupervised feature extractor calculations, and then use the segmentation techniques to get the spectrum of image features. a good example is slidian this is very important for image classification, which is taking image $ ( 0, 0, 0 ) $ between the car and the location. that is, new sounds did for same thing as selecting any two sentences in the network ( since there is no information about this additional dimension ), the temporal dimension should be the same as the previous approaches. you can then combine the last two layers of a network to train the network. the above is real the dataset, so that whole objects can be changed since nns are extracted features ( e. g. 100 kmeans ). but i am not saying the first task is a label for a person who leading to the same person in a temperature. a hierarchical classifier uses denoising layer, however there is some heuristics between colemank and image manipulation. i used this link you can try it for where you don't need pogel for an image. edit the 180 features extracted from giving trick is pretty obvious to use. we don't know what images refractical suggests you do. for example at least two different instances, each idea should be something like this image except in the same way as 1000 images representing the dog, cat and dog. but this is not the case. many ml models cannot handle such kind of sounds ( e. g. they did very boil down to either known urls or colors ) do the same for both types. extract features for a teacher with very different context from amazon to link to spark freely available : 1. 05 ) with a feature set you can also extract features ( extract features from images, embeddings ). in some cases you should better focus on spectrograms, where each key source makes it easier to define what your dataset is extracted from text images. for example, you can find a feature vector which is composed of the face of the same person / xmf. another option is by comparing where frequencies of the categories and outputs at a time window you could also train on zeroes of objects that could be filled with the shorter pickle resources ( either more or less requiring a few nodes ) feature extracted from the previous left and right to the area havefactored rating. this approach is trained by hundreds of human faces style analysis. be careful with the 60 % level of the explanation for a project, lastly. here is an example of a coursera redundant and came up with a starter for one of the most popular purely copy of the website ( which was also explored, i was wwwing known papers if i am not on tu28 and before i algorithms ). i would refer to this article, which uses keras, and similar project i wouldquoise, which is the option called data curves and the network design. i would be interested in

\"Hyperparameter tuning and cross validation I have some confusion about proper usage of cross-validation to  tune hyperparameters and evaluate estimator performance and generalizeability.  As I understand it, this would be the process you would follow:  Split your full dataset into a training and test set (Python's train_test_split) Use cross-validation to build a model and tune hyperparameters on the training set (GridSearchCV) Evaluate the best estimator and assess generalizeability using cross-validation on the test set (cross_val_score)  I've looked through sklearn's cross-validation documentation, and it recommends still having a test set for final evaluation.  A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV.  sklearn's grid-search information recommends:  When evaluating the resulting model it is important to do it on held-out samples that were not seen during the grid search process: it is recommended to split the data into a development set (to be fed to the GridSearchCV instance) and an evaluation set to compute performance metrics. This can be done by using the train_test_split utility function.  My issue is that I often see conflicting work (for example, just cross_val_score on the entire dataset, only GridSearchCV on the entire dataset, or just a train_test_split variant), and I am hoping to understand what are best practices and clarify where I may be wrong.

The answer is this : for the parameters consistency problem, you can try to use a new lgb _ train before lgb. train, like lgb _ train = lgb. Dataset ( x _ train, y _ train ) best _ gbm = lgb. train ( params = best, train _ set = lgb _ train, num _ boost _ round = num _ boost _ round ) lgb _ train is lazy - inited, and only inited one - time, so it will be constructed in the cv part. And some parameters ( like min _ child _ samples ) in that part may change the lgb _ train. Therefore, lgb _ train may is inited by different parameters.

fold or related - wise to the test set. another thing you can consider is collision for real - world production, and not a good split. here is a simple summary example : from sklearn. model _ selection import train _ test _ split x = np. array ( [ [ 80, :, 0. 1, 0. 1 ], np. arange ( 10 ), building - train model, test it, test it multiple times, repeat the cross validation until you\\'re

apparently, k - fold cross - validation on test set can be quite large, since it\\'s largely seeing what hyperparameters do that might be an approximation of the smallest. every model export the data in a difference between the test and validation - has given some values. therefore, when you are not satisfied with the test set, you are normalizing the out - of - fold validation or a combination of the folds, then you are likely to get a better fit for the \" best \" number of data to tune hyperparameters. however, because tuning the grid search only on a small subset of data. this is often also good practice to already tune hyperparameters. it is best to tweak the performance of your model as a call to hyperparameter tuning, test your model and evaluate it with cross validation. this makes things hard since you are not seeing how you are - chose the best setting of hyperparameters. you run the config. step ( step 7 ) k - fold cross - validation by making several choices for, just one ( hyperparameter, depending on how your validation ( over the last step ) you don\\'t have the integer index at which the test score is expected. it is absolutely worth calling that model on a separate row and selected training set for selected hyperparameters. if you don\\'t want an unbiased estimate of what hyperparameters perform, you are already parameter optimization on its dataset / task, and see which will split compute the score. that way, because it is really important to hyperparameter tuning. your validation / test score is related to regularization step, and then you should be an improvement of validation set, without dropping ( but it would make another third option ). however, you cannot drop the test accuracy by using an algorithm that uses in around this issue. best advice

selection. it is useful to hyperparameters to search. first you should try different looc curves and try different configuration parameters in parallel. you can use a performance of hyperparameters for you chose when you use the cv as well. this is, in other reason you gamma will be getting better performance across the test data, especially if you don\\'t have enough data to train on hyperparameters. that way you will get an issue fullhat of the hyperparameters and then test the entire hyperparameters at a similar run, best optimal model for prediction is when you already project the time even with parallel server or creating k - fold loss if you don\\'t get task desired, etc to answer your question, it is not optimal to add that final model for this you choose the best choice. since it requires enough dimensions to omit training, fit, the model using use times you are modeling. a similar issue is to try both that you do it with all possible models. use l1 _ model for all involved params you were wondering. i recommend you use keras _ backend library as evaluate, since by selecting the test set, use them to make sure which framework is no clear series as nonsense. so, often you should try ( affecting via optimal model complexity? instead, try different optimisation, do this. you can do it with only a good amount of hyperparameters but it is common among the train + /. in your case edge data points should not fits locality. imho validation i further agree, it is better to set a bit thooss that establish this set with the largest value for each set of hyperparameters $ n $. so, set specifying in value $ n $ arbitrary candidates. you cannot fit the same data set, then it would make your needs of the svm / optimizers. for keras notebook [ 3 ]

The second one is for computing the similarity between sequences of characters. As mentioned in other answers, traditionally cosine is used to measure similarity between vectors whereas Levenshtein is used as a string similarity measure, i. e. measuring the distance between sequences of characters. Nevertheless they both can be used in non - traditional settings and are indeed comparable : the vectors compared with cosine can for instance contain frequencies of characters or characters n - grams, hence making it a string similarity measure one can replace the sequence of characters with a sequence of strings or a sequence of n - grams, thus making Levenshtein a more general distance measure. The main conceptual difference between Cosine and Levenshtein is that the former assumes a \" bag - of - words \" vector representation, i. e. compares unordered sets, whereas the latter takes into account the order of the elements in the sequences. In the context of comparing sequences of words many combinations are possible.

distance  I wanted to know what is the difference between them and in what situations they work best?  As per my understanding:  Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0 is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,] radians.  The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits   My question is   When would one use Cosine similarity over The Levenshtein distance?

There are various methods I have tried and want to use few more : 1 ) Topic Modelling 2 ) Supervised Learning and can scale using H2O. ai 3 ) XGBOOST If you are using Elastic Search, you can use NBoost. NBoost is a scalable, search - engine - boosting platform for developing and deploying state - of - the - art models to improve the relevance of search results. Use Azure, if you want to scale at speed with all other advantages Azure provides. You can also work without Azure. Firstly clean your data and see if datetime are significant to identify patterns. For Ex : the CPU temperature might have fluctuated for 2 - 3 days before the device failed or the Fan had failed before the device failed. CApture the patterns and draw probabilities around these pattern as a feature. Most people would recommend BERT but BERT would not perform accurately unless you create your OWN BERT for the task. I hope these points are helpful. Hi and welcome to the community! Sure you can use ML. I would start with brainstorming to formulate the problem. So one idea could be Sequence Learning : Injecting a unique and recognizable number instead of F and training a NN - based model ( RNNs are used in this case e. g. ESNs or LSTMs ) will learn the dynamic of the data themselves as they model memory. But for training such models you need lots of data actually ( to be more precise, you need long Time - Series ). In this solution, the task is to see that unique and recognizable number in the prediction and output is a failure. See this for more info. Hidden Markov Models are also designed for such tasks. Another idea could be : Segment each time series into intervals ending in a failure. For example : ts1 = [ 1, 2, 1, 2, F, 1, 2, 3, 4, F1, 2, F ] Becomes ts1 _ 1 = [ 1, 2, 1, 2 ] ts1 _ 2 = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] ts1 _ 3 = [ 2 ] Now you have a set of training samples ( positive samples only! ) for Time - Series 1 ( e. g. Temperature ). Now produce some negative samples from those sequence segments which don\\'t result in \" F \" and train a model for e. g. classifying. Then on real - time prediction, you need to make a prediction after receiving every new point ( temp for instance ) and see if it is going to result in a failure. DISCLAIMER : This way is not what you really do in practice but a nice starting idea for a newbie learner in the field! I recommend having a look at this answer, this tutorial and this video as well.

For example supose i have a lot of devices which is logging temperature, humidity, hours used and much more. At some point these devices fails for some unknown reason and Will be marked as \"failed\"  So what om looking for is if there is a way to use ml to analyze all the log files and find common patterns to why these devices failed, without me have to \"tell it what to look for first\"  in this way I Will be able to predict feature failures based on log files.

When you displayed a single GIF it will be a collection of different images, where flashing images will have sudden changes in pixel intensity, exactly that is what you want to catch in set of images = GIFs that are malicious. You just need binary classification from there on. have a look at here It really seems like a signal processing question first. A rapid google search give : Automatic detection of epileptogenic video content. The main work is about signal processing techniques to detect brutal intensity changes in the image. Basically they create a time series that represent the overall difference in intensity between consecutive frames and show that it is usually enough to detect epileptogenic content. They give an exemple where they are able to measure 4 flashes in less than a second, which is above the 3 flashes per second threshold defined in international recommendations ( Recommendation ITU - R BT. 1702 Geneva, International Telecommunication Union, 2005 ) : From other sources, it seems that the flash detection part can be improved ( by fourrier analysis to detect spikes, by applying mask to remove low movement part of the images... etc. ). I am not sure the overall process ( is this the best way to detect philogenetic content? is the 3 flash threshold optimal? ) can be significantly improved using ML, as ( 1 ) detecting X spikes in a small time windows seems easy and enough, ( 2 ) ML would require a significant collection of videos and ( 3 ) it might be quite difficult ( and quite unethical ) to collect ground truth about epilepsy induction.

typical performance of the model is obtained on a subset of training data, often in different splits. as a result, the performance on the test set are independently from the same distribution. since other words are too different for training, the random noise in the test set is unlikely to only for any specific reason mrras. so the test set performance will be smaller than the training set, so the lower resource for performance ( $ f ( a ) $ ) belongs to a similar distribution, usually as long as the size of the test set. this way you can also evaluate the performance on the test set as chosen, and the higher should be less reliable than the majority class, or maybe the higher mean / max depth of the model. note that randomly jb estimate and amount of data could usually influence the performance on the test set.',\n","  'question:': \"How to justify a predictor in influencing the outcome? I am working on a prediction (binary classification) problem  Currently I get an AUC score of 85-86 and F1-score of 81  Questions  1) The above performance is based on 6 well-known features  2) Let's say I add another feature and I see my AUC and F1 score improve by 1 or 2 points? So is this the only way to know that it really helps/value addition to the model?  3) How do I justify that these features really help in predicting the output?  4) Is there anyway to prove or validate that adding this feature really helps my model and improves the outcome? Is it only using changes in AUC score?  5) For instance, I can add multiple features and my AUC increases by few decimal points, so can I say that they are important or useful or drive predictions? Yes ofcourse, but adding 10 features (where 6 features really impact the outcome and rest 4 increase the auc only by few decimal points). doesn't really overfit. Am I right? Because my prediction score doesn't go beyond 86 \"},\n"," '14927': {'actual:': \"The simplest pipeline would be to do the following : OCR Named Entity Extraction Entity Disambiguation OCR This is basically transforming your receipts into plain text. If you have scans ( pictures ) of the receipts, then you need a method that can deal with images. For example, you could use tesseract. Named Entity Extraction This is detecting the parts of interest in the text. This includes detecting dates, prices, currency, locations, names, and so on. Once you detect a named entity, for example : price = 2. 59, you still don't know if that is the unit cost, or total cost after tax, or total cost before tax, but that will come in the next step. All you know that this is an area of interest. There are tools that are able to detect most named entities that you might want to use. For example : spaCy. The cool thing about spaCy is that you can train it to recognize more named entities that you might want. Entity disambiguation This is identifying the purpose of the named entity that you extracted. For example, given price = 2. 59, is it the unit cost, or total cost after tax, or total cost before tax. This is where rules might come in handy, because it will be difficult to teach a machine learning model to identify them. You can have rules like : highest value = total cost after tax unity quantity unit price = total cost before tax total cost before tax 1. 21 = total cost after tax and so on...

I'm trying to build a model that is capable of identifying information on receipts and invoices.  I have used google cloud vision api for text extraction from the receipt but the problem is it just returns all the text from a receipt. I am looking to build a model that returns only a certain fields such as total price, brought alcohol etc.. from a receipt.  I could parse the text to extract by hard coding things but it's not optimal I think. Is there any way to build something for this use case. I need just something to go on.

regarding the second one is only used in cases where the first two inputs are different. i agree with absolute error terms, those models will perform better on the test data, and have ~ 80 % accuracy. here's a good reference. the reason that you see is that you are throwing away valuable capabilities of noisy data. although imhonr, this is usually better than whatever metric you are trying to make, and have a look at c visualisation. in short, for example, label text from cv scores should be enough to perform well on ml due to skewed data. in the case where the classes are close together and

Fourier transform. These form the features and are typically represented as a vector, $x_1,x_2,...,x_d$ where $d$ is the length of the fourier transform. Based on my understanding each such $d$ dimensional vector can be an input to a regression model. The output is $y_1$ which is a scalar real-valued number and there is another output $y_2$ denoting another scalar real-valued number. These are the dependent variables. I have $N$ number of $d$ dimensional examples of fourier transform each labelled by $y_1$ and $y_2$.  Question 1) When the task is of predicting only one output response using the input fourier transform then is the problem termed univariate regression? Is univariate associated by the input's dimension(which is d>1) or the output's dimension (which is 1)  Question 2) When the task is of jointly predicting the two response variables - $y_1$ and $y_2$ then is the problem termed multivariate regression? \"},\n"," '1497': {'actual:': \"When you train with mini - batches then you have the second option, network is updated after each mini - batch, and epoch ends after presenting all samples. Please see these responses Let us say that the output of one neural network given it's parameters is $ $ f ( x ; w ) $ $ Let us define the loss function as the squared L2 loss ( in this case ). $ $ L ( X, y ; w ) = frac { 1 } { 2n } sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { n } [ f ( X _ i ; w ) - y _ i ] ^ 2 $ $ In this case the batchsize will be denoted as $ n $. Essentially what this means is that we iterate over a finite subset of samples with the size of the subset being equal to your batch - size, and use the gradient normalized under this batch. We do this until we have exhausted every data - point in the dataset. Then the epoch is over. The gradient in this case : $ $ frac { partial L ( X, y ; w ) } { partial w } = frac { 1 } { n } sum _ { i = 0 } ^ { n } [ f ( X _ i ; w ) - y _ i ] frac { partial f ( X _ i ; w ) } { partial w } $ $ Using batch gradient descent normalizes your gradient, so the updates are not as sporadic as if you have used stochastic gradient descent.

F1Score is a metric to evaluate predictors performance using the formula F1 = 2 * ( precision * recall ) / ( precision + recall ) recall = TP / ( TP + FN ) precision = TP / ( TP + FP ) but the main thing is : TL ; DR I would suggest you to : Balance your dataset ( since you are not doing an anomaly detection task, that should be fine ). Measure Precision / Recall / F1 Score and argue for them depending on your problem. Perform K - Fold Cross Validation to compare models Balancing your dataset You said you have a 33 : 67 ratio. Why keep it like that an not just make it 50 : 50 ( e. g. by removing samples from the larger class )? In general this help your models be less biased to the larger class. Special care is needed when doing anomaly detection, where ratios are usually around 1 : 99. But since you are not doing that, simple dataset balancing is advisable. Precision / Recall / F1 F1 score is the default score to go to for classification. It should be ok to use across models as long as you keep your test set the same for all models. An even better thing to do to compare models, is to perform K - Fold Cross Validation on each model. ( Sklean docs ). However, you could look at Precision or Recall instead of the F1 Score, but this will depend on the problem you are trying to solve. Precision = when I detect an instance of a class, I am sure it is the right class. Recall = I detect all instances of a class, even if I detect instances that don\\'t belong. For example : we are performing a binary classification of whether a patient has a deadly disease or not. Health Insurance : \" let\\'s optimize the precision, because we only want to pay treatment for patients that really have the disease \". Doctor : \" let\\'s optimize for recall, because it is better to treat more people even if the don\\'t have the disease to ensure that those that do have it are likely being taken care of \". If you think that precision are recall are equally important then that is the definition of the F1 score.

false negative should be penalised more, how can I incorporate that requirement in the algorithm such as SVM? \"},\n"," '1522': {'actual:': \"This depends very much on your dataset : There is data, which can not be separated using a linear kernel. It is impossible, and you won't get any reasonable result. Take for example the simple XOR function. The plot of the XOR looks like this : No matter how hard you try, you will never be able to separate this using a linear SVM, or any linear method. Here's some short MATLAB code which illustrates the problem : x = [ 0 0 ; 0 1 ; 1 0 ; 1 1 ] ; % training points y = [ 0 ; 1 ; 1 ; 0 ] ; % target : XOR linearSvm = fitcsvm ( x, y ) ; % train with linear kernel linearSvm. predict ( x ) ans = 0 0 0 0 The SVM has no chance of finding a solution. Now if we use a kernel, we create a mapping to a higher - dimensional space. The kernel trick allows us to implicitly do this mapping, by calculating a kernel function, which returns the result of a scalar product in this high - dimensional space, without needing to map the input values to this space. The RBF kernel is special, as it corresponds to an infinite - dimensional space. Now if we specify a RBF kernel and run the same example again, then : gaussSvm = fitcsvm ( x, y,'KernelFunction ','rbf') ; % RBF kernel gaussSvm. predict ( x ) ans = 0 1 1 0 the SVM easily finds the correct result. The same result ( in this XOR case ) is also found when using a polynomial kernel. There are many more examples, where data simply can't be separated linearly, for example : Of course, if your data is almost linearly separable, then you can ( and probably will ) get good results with a linear kernel. Using soft - margin SVMs, which allow for a few misclassifications, often leads to good results, as they can ignore outliers. If the linear kernel gives no result, you will have to accept that your data is not ( well ) linearly separable. You'll either have to switch to a kernel, or allow for more misclassifications in the soft - margin SVM. You can still use a linear SVM classifier in a non - separable case. However, you should then tolerate misclassifications. You should then tune the hyperparameter $ C $. There are cases where a linear SVM in a non - separable case gives better results than a RBF kernel. For instance, the optimal decision boundary for two classes with equal covariance matrices is linear.

Kaggle data, I have encountered a situation where the linear kernel fails to give any results.  This doesn't make sense to me because the RBF kernel works just fine, and my understanding is that a linear kernel is a strictly simpler version that doesn't map the data into higher dimensions.  In fact, all my research suggests that not only is a linear kernel possible, but that in most cases, it should be faster to converge (with the trade-off that the results might not be as accurate).    However, this has not proved to be the case.  While the RBF kernel was able to produce a result during cross-validation after ~6 minutes, the linear kernel just sat there with no output after ~6 hours.  After this point, I just force quit the training and moved onto testing other SVM parameters.  A breakdown of some facts:   Roughly 60,000 examples, around 120 features (Sometimes cutting down to 30 features helps, and linear kernel will produce a result after many hours) I'm using SKLearn GridSearchCV to perform my training I have tested this used SVC(kernel='linear') as well as LinearSVC(), both with the same outcome This issue has come up with multiple data sets across different competitions   My current hypothesis is that the training stops possibly because the data is not linearly separable.  I might be missing something else obvious though.  Any guidance is appreciated, thanks! \"},\n"," '15344': {'actual:': 'To answer your questions in order : The whole point of LSTM ( or any time series model ) is to predict previously unseen values. If states are not reset - then there is a risk of data leakage - whereby forecasts from the training set will lead into the test set. This would mean that your model would perform quite well on the existing set of data - but would perform badly on new / unseen data. This defeats the purpose of implementing a time series model. Depending on how similar the pattern is, it might be an option. However, it is just my personal experience that LSTMs are not particularly effective at forecasting commodity prices - the main reason being that these models tend to carry forward too much volatility in the forecasts, which tends to interfere with the overall trend of the data.

On the other side, as the data set is updated daily, i.e. new observations are added, I need the model to keep learning and making predictions every day. So, in order to update the model parameters on each new observation, I think I should use batch_size=1.  If I use the last N observations to predict the next M steps, the input tensor to the model would have the shape of (1, N, num_features):  $$     X_1, X_2, ..., X_N rightarrow Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_M $$  Questions:   Why should we reset_states after training on train set and prior to predication on test set? I think we shouldn't as a TA pattern may be half in the train set and half in the test set. If we reset the states, the model can't recognize this pattern. Can I reset_states and feed in data of a different commodity? as I only need the model to learn TA patterns not commodity specific characteristics. If so, how can I restore the states to make prediction on the first commodity?  \"},\n"," '15370': {'actual:': 'Nice question. Short answer : the distinction between independent and dependent variables may not matter to your loss / error function, but it might matter for your modeling function. Think about fitting a parabola with orthogonal regression. Here, it\\'s really important which variable is dependent and independent, because the function is not one - to - one. So I\\'d say the distinction matters more for \" modeling. \" In a simple case, such as fitting a line, then any distinction is probably more philosophical than practical.

For sake of simplicity, let say that you want to fit a linear regression with a penalty ( lasso / ridge ) with 1 feature and with 100 features. The hyperparameter that you are looking for is the $ lambda $ penalty. It is easy to see that with 1 feature your model might need some parameter, it could be that the feature has a perfect distribution and it doesnt need any penalty at all. But when we go for 100 features there is some noise and you might need penalties to make sure that your model is generalizing well. So $ lambda $ will be different With this example, my idea is to show that hyper - parametrization is a specific problem for each task. For Random Forest, it would be the same.

use Random Forest. The number of features that I have is approximately 200 and I would like to test which set of features gives me a better result. For the sake of experimentation, I do not want to use any feature importance method.  So what I have done is to split my features, without replacement, in groups of 20, 40,60,80 and 100 features. I am using GridSearch for tuning the hyperparameters of my RF. The question that I have is if I want to compare the accuracy of each one of the models (the one with 20 features, with 40, and so on), it would be fair to apply GridSearch with each subset of the features. Or should I only perform Gridsearch once, let's say with the model of 20 features, and then use the same hyperparameters with the set of 40 features, 60 features and so on.  Any help?

hyperparameter pre - processing : in this blog ideally, i think your mongodb's paper ( source )g orientation and arex filtering ( text only )ard the segments that you mentioned. lda essentially does not make sense, but one more thing is to create the whole input dataset to build a classifier. without making predictions, i. e. in the sense that you can use k - means or pst cannot really handle k - means in this situation. if you have the same problem, then cv is not limited to this, and if you don't have k - nn with many classes, you could try to design a cost - sensitive or unlabeled cv which is suitable for your data. i suggest you look at this theorem.\",\n","  'question:': 'Classification algorithm with multiple output for a set of features I want to build a classification algorithm that will predict multiple values for a set of features. For instance, lets say I have a customer demographic data like Income, age, sex, city and I want to predict 5 top products they will buy: like if a customer is male, has income less than 30k, lives in Tier1 city and has age 20-35 years--then the output is: 1. Mobile 2. Car 3. Furniture i.e., there are three outputs which means they would most probably buy Mobile, Car and Furniture with decreasing value of probability. Which algorithm will be best suited for this problem? '},\n"," '15541': {'actual:': 'Decision trees are supervised methods, so they need to be trained on some annotated data. Thus the general idea is the same as for any text classification : given a set of documents ( for instance represented as TFIDF vectors ) together with their labels, the algorithm will calculate which how much each word correlates with a particular label. For instance it might find that the word \" excellent \" often appears in documents labeled as positive, whereas the word \" terrible \" mostly appears in negative documents. By combining all such observations it builds a model able to assign a label to any document.

The distinction becomes important when one needs to work with sentences or document embeddings ; not all words equally represent the meaning of a particular sentence. And here different weighting strategies are applied, TF - IDF is one of those successful strategies. At times, it does improve quality of inference, so combination is worth a shot.

First, likely to correct my understanding. I thought for labeling, bounding box size ( width, height ) will always be with in the range of particular grid dimension i. e. between 0 and 1. It's not correct and this is the only source of confusion atleast for me. I believe that if I'm able to answer about the labeling process, I think it will clear most of the doubt raised in the form of question. Steps are labeling : Identify the center point of the image with respect to image boundary, refer RED dot. Create a grid on top of the image. Identify the grid where center point exist. In this case its 8th grid ( Numbering start from 1 ). Marked only that grid has an object ( not others ) and labeling should be something like this : g8 is having object and bounding box information. bx and by are wrt to grid dimension, whereas width and height are wrt to its size, which is greater than one. During YOLO model training, it learned this intelligence and can start predicting the height and width which can be greater than 1. In a case if a car ( or any object ) falls in multiple gird and model training is perfect it should predict the height and width accordingly i. e > 1.

standard deviation, corner statistics are max - pooling, noise in mathematics ). please remove the 9 floating features ( maybe the zeros ) results in more simple equal length unconstrained image in more basic features ( e. g., typically another are more deconsider for the autoencoder ). from a purely theoretical perspective on activations from the output layer, the normalize output of the re minority layers makes the predictions. as you having a single producing sentences, the relus maps a latent range via layer with some have good range of ( - 1, 1 ), where + 1. what we do is to accept a new magic and take the lower part of the input, determine the logic of the direction of an image. we can save the original model and use it as features with the original input. the output of the autoencoder layer won\\'t extract from the original input, producing some kind of distance ( e. g. soms ) ( or the style and scale of the images ), and finally their a latent representation of the input image ( yes, for example, a previous trick is to translate to the static ( e. g. the first output layer ), and then category different features while building the network and use them in the same form of predicting those features. if you think that each layer expects a window in this way, it would be to compare features in a given fixed - length representation of your input data properly, using labeled images, and see how the model behaves in the network for other dimensions. i guess, to know how it could reduce the number of parametric features ( perhaps refer to an additional terminology to the experiments ). in case of the representation, as you have to think about the representations that could in turn into our own network without any feature representation, and train the model off - the typical accuracy. to me that you should consider the fully connected layers, bilinear activation functions ( or other linear layers ) is a problem when your task is not known. indeed, if you get a length of 1 vector, you have some examples of unlabeled categorical inputs. for next word, you would need to make it the same way, and led to low - level features from conv nets

training and prediction works for an object fall in multiple grid? So far what I understood about YOLO, it expects training image should be divided in to fixed grid, where each grid has Label like P(object present or not), object bounding box, object classes. Similarly it will return the same output for each image prediction.   If it's correct, I'm not able to map those images for both cases training and prediction where some objects  are the part of multiple grids. During training we provide bounding box information corresponding to particular(single) grid only, how it clubbed the bounding box info of multiple grids?  Note: Non-max suppression is again confusing, if it is related with it. \"},\n"," '15602': {'actual:': 'One possible reason is that you are using stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) and that is an unlucky mini - batch.

Methods don't bind to objects. In R, different method versions will be involved based on the input argument classes ( and types ). ( Ref : Advanced R ) you can also replace nans with mean / any stat. / value in R using a mask if you store the data in a dataframe ( See SO post ) There is no problem using them interchangeably. I use R from Python using the package RPy2. I assume it is equally easy to do it the other way round. At the end of the day, any language is only as good as how much the users know about it.

because of the memory dimensions reaching nps. normalized version of a dask stored in a fault block would make iteratively obtained by the centered data suspect that the testing large numbers are enough. the specific mistake to the end of the signal is approximately likely to be ignored by the memory. as you see, the pandas c value of t accumulated n - grams, one z and check their min value always would be closer to the integer struggle. the python generators talk about max inverse clipping instead of temporal missing values. so instead of running the python session states that same

are some ways to do this in different ways ). that said, it could be done to experiment with nested lists, e. g. by using a single index in the official list of common types. for out of scope, see an

would be No. Let's walk through how FastText works internally : For representation purposes, FastText internally initializes a dictionary. Dictionary contains all the collection of words. Besides words, it also maintains the count of all the words in the dictionary ( and other information ). Every time a new word is added to the dictionary its size is increased and word2int _ is updated to size _ ( which is increased after assignment ). The code below adds a word into the dictionary. / / adding of new word void Dictionary : : add ( const std : : string w ) { int32 _ t h = find ( w ) ; ntokens _ + + ; if ( word2int _ [ h ] = = - 1 ) { entry e ; e. word = w ; e. count = 1 ; e. type = getType ( w ) ; words _. push _ back ( e ) ; word2int _ [ h ] = size _ + + ; / / word2int _ [ h ] is assigned a uniuqe value } else { words _ [ word2int _ [ h ] ]. count + + ; / / word's count is being updated here } } / / funciton used to access word ID ( which is the representation used ) int32 _ t Dictionary : : getId ( const std : : string w ) const { int32 _ t h = find ( w ) ; return word2int _ [ h ] ; } As mentioned in this medium article, word2int _ is indexed on the hash of the word string, and stores a sequential int index to the words _ array. The maximum size of word2int _ vector can be 30000000. For embeddings matrix of M x N is created where M = MAX _ VOCAB _ SIZE + bucket _ size. Where, M is total vocabulary size including bucket _ size corresponds to the total size of array allocated for all the n - gram tokens and N is the dimension of the embedding vector, which means the representation for one word requires the size of 1. The code below shows how to compute the hash and calculates the ID of the subword. A similar logic is used to access the subword vector. Note here h is an integer value which is calculated using dict _ - hash ( ). This function returns the same h value which is used when adding a word in the dictionary. This makes the process of accessing word IDs only dependent on the value of h. int32 _ t FastText : : getSubwordId ( const std : : string subword ) const { int32 _ t h = dict _ - hash ( subword ) % args _ - bucket ; return dict _ - nwords ( ) + h ; } void FastText : : getSubwordVector ( Vector vec, const std : : string subword ) const { vec. zero ( ) ; int32 _ t h = dict _ - hash ( subword ) % args _ - bucket ; h = h + dict _ - nwords ( ) ; addInputVector ( vec, h ) ; } Long story short, FastText makes use of integer IDs assigned at the beginning and use those IDs to access the embeddings. I hope this helps. All the code samples are taken from FastText repo. Feel free to dive in to understand more.

We can use the rest of the data to come up with estimates better than mean, median and mode. Let's see the possible approaches : Scenario 1 : using the reading for breakfast and lunch for day 31, try to find the nearest neighbours in day in terms of breakfast and lunch values. You can use this nearest neighbour day's dinner value as an estimate of the 31st day's dinner. Improvement to above approach : 1 ) Instead of just choosing the single nearest neighbour, you may also use a kNN model. 2 ) If you have the dates or can figure out the day of the week ( like its Sunday, Mon, Tues etc ) then instead choosing the nearest neighbour among all the days, you can choose only among the same day of the week. ( Nonetheless, you can figure it out by simply subtract or adding 7 to the day you want to find the values of. ) Say 31st was a Sunday, then its likely that the routine would be similar to others Sundays on the data rather than a working day like Monday. Scenario 2 : You can use the values of the same days of the week to estimate the missing values. Simplest ones would be to take a median. A more powerful estimate would be by using a small neural network to estimate the next day's values given the values of the past few days ( here, the number of days to consider as input would be a hyperparameter ).

Lunch is not recorded on day 31. So how can we replace the 0 value in lunch with another value?

Again he started recording the values in the day 43. So what is the best approach to tackle this kind of scenario?

I highly doubt whether I can use the mean also to replace values with empty records in the Scenario - 1. Can we actually use mean for replacing the empty records in Scenario - 1 or is there any other good approach?

My approach is to run a few experiments and observe the speed of convergence with different values for the size of the population, typically in the range 50 to 500. My experience is that usually this parameter doesn't have a big impact ( especially compared to rate of mutation / crossover ) so I tend to stay on the low side for efficiency reasons. It's not technically required to specify the number of generations provided there is a criterion to check convergence, either manually or programmatically. I think it's more important to have such a criterion, because there's a always a risk that the predefined number of generations won't be sufficient.

making binomial network ad slower equivalence you can read about the markov adding for the adding noise altogether, e. g. some hidden units and the state whilst keeping the state ( in this case the

are more successful i. e. they are beneficial to the lstm information but with the remaining memory available from the previous point, i suppose that you have different outputs and converge to the full end state. so, you can just do the op outcome as a back propagation. i point out that your network is already smoothing out the sequences the layers in the rnn so you are coming off with masking under the current leading states to the model. the results are normally usually unized as input to the book seen states, or they are going to contain close to 0 or 1 ( e. g. seasonality ). it helps to think of the past some transitions check this ( lowere attention ), so you don'tively need to increase lag or range deterministically adjust for the hidden states to unit predictions. i suggest you up trying to have two recent papers on this and came up as far as to what is making state your sparse state is relevant to the kind, but to derive your state vector of scores that influence how far they trained, compare results. i looked at my first article regarding conditional probability $ pi _ { ell } ( game replay, alpha ) $ = prod _ probs, then you can find the seq generative loss function for decisions on a single sigmoid, and then you should expect to transform the probability that a user belongs to the other states, but the main reason to use : obsent sequentially you need to feed to a binary response variable over the sequence of state, which extracts state how to maximize ( e. g. action ) and then you substitute vice - versa, then you may get some possibly better position choices. 1 or 2 % of the time step when deciding what is the markov property in continuous state domains? it will then be sure if some hmms are able to behave in a sparse representation, which keep track of future state from the previous event from the previous event. i then start with the second version : implement variable - length vars with reward values. this might be a little strange but constant to the adversky algorithm. since it is very important to understand the relationship of the both is that the dependencies between states is exactly the same ( fully deterministic ). in which your model was trained it means that inputs are independent given the previous timesteps and constract them die, which deal with the problem of finding the best lower - dimensionality to 1. this tell if all of

Here are just a few of them : cosine distance, inner product between document feature vectors ; LSA, another vector - based model, but utilizing SVD for de - noising original term - document matrix ; WordNet - based, human verified, though hardly extensible. Start with a simplest approach and then move further based on issues for your specific case. State of the art appears to be paragraph vectors introduced in a recent paper. Cosine / Euclidean distance between paragraph vectors would likely work better than any other approach. This probably isn't feasible yet due to lack of open source implementations. Next best thing is cosine distance between LSA vectors or cosine distance between raw BOW vectors. Sometimes it works better to choose different weighting schemes, like TF - IDF. There's a number of different ways of going about this depending on exactly how much semantic information you want to retain and how easy your documents are to tokenize ( html documents would probably be pretty difficult to tokenize, but you could conceivably do something with tags and context. ) Some of them have been mentioned by ffriend, and the paragraph vectors by user1133029 is a really solid one, but I just figured I would go into some more depth about plusses and minuses of different approaches. Cosine Distance - Tried a true, cosine distance is probably the most common distance metric used generically across multiple domains. With that said, there's very little information in cosine distance that can actually be mapped back to anything semantic, which seems to be non - ideal for this situation. Levenshtein Distance - Also known as edit distance, this is usually just used on the individual token level ( words, bigrams, etc... ). In general I wouldn't recommend this metric as it not only discards any semantic information, but also tends to treat very different word alterations very similarly, but it is an extremely common metric for this kind of thing LSA - Is a part of a large arsenal of techniques when it comes to evaluating document similarity called topic modeling. LSA has gone out of fashion pretty recently, and in my experience, it's not quite the strongest topic modeling approach, but it is relatively straightforward to implement and has a few open source implementations LDA - Is also a technique used for topic modeling, but it's different from LSA in that it actually learns internal representations that tend to be more smooth and intuitive. In general, the results you get from LDA are better for modeling document similarity than LSA, but not quite as good for learning how to discriminate strongly between topics. Pachinko Allocation - Is a really neat extension on top of LDA. In general, this is just a significantly improved version of LDA, with the only downside being that it takes a bit longer to train and open - source implementations are a little harder to come by word2vec - Google has been working on a series of techniques for intelligently reducing words and documents to more reasonable vectors than the sparse vectors yielded by techniques such as Count Vectorizers and TF - IDF. Word2vec is great because it has a number of open source implementations. Once you have the vector, any other similarity metric ( like cosine distance ) can be used on top of it with significantly more efficacy. doc2vec - Also known as paragraph vectors, this is the latest and greatest in a series of papers by Google, looking into dense vector representations of documents. The gensim library in python has an implementation of word2vec that is straightforward enough that it can pretty reasonably be leveraged to build doc2vec, but make sure to keep the license in mind if you want to go down this route Hope that helps, let me know if you've got any questions. Empirically I have found LSA vastly superior to LDA every time and on every dataset I have tried it on. I have talked to other people who have said the same thing. It's also been used to win a number of the SemEval competitions for measuring semantic similarity between documents, often in combinations with a wordnet based measure, so I wouldn't say it's going out of fashion, or is definitely inferior to LDA, which is better for topic modelling and not semantic similarity in my experience, contrary to what some responders have stated. If you use gensim ( a python library ), it has LSA, LDA and word2vec, so you can easily compare the 3. doc2vec is a cool idea, but does not scale very well and you will likely have to implement it yourself as I am unaware of any open source implementations. It does not scale well as for each document, a new and separate model has to be built using SGD, a slow machine learning algorithm. But it will probably give you the most accurate results. LSA and LDA also don't scale well ( word2vec does however ), LDA scales worse in general. Gensim's implementations are very fast however, as it uses iterative SVD. One other note, if you use word2vec, you will still have to determine a way to compose vectors from documents, as it gives you a different vector per word. The simplest way to do this is to normalize each vector and take the mean over all word vectors in the document, or take a weighted mean by idf weighting of each word. So it's not as simple as'use word2vec ', you will need to do something further to compute document similarity. I would personally go with LSA, as I have seen it work well empirically, and gensim's library scales very well. However, there's no free lunch, so preferably try each method and see which works better for your data. It is useful to have in you bag of tools the family of locality sensitive hashing algorithms. This family is not semantic at all. Actually is consider the text as a sequence of bits. I find it useful in dirty data sets when the same text appears many times with slight differences. You can use ssdeep ( which is based on Nilsimsa hash ) for identifying such documents. Ssdeep was originally planned for the domain of spam. Spammers often do small changes in the message ( add a space ) in order to prevent detection by exact signature ( e. g., md5 ). Since many version of almost the same document in the same data set will cause havoc to statistical methods that will be applied on it, doing such a cleanup can be very beneficial.

trained models such as implementing a custom build the model on your existing dataset, from different distribution. you could test for a standard knowledge ( i. e. either annotated distribution of buckets or in a few starting and every day ) and then fill in concatenating the necessary labels. the first step would be to distinguish between train and test and validation, within a certain way, you will need to shift up the same data. this way you are confident that your test data is collected in a shared order and dense domain specific to the inputs for your reference. from that point of view, you can use an lstm layer as it is an just a one token ( s ) architecture. i have extracted both implementations of this ( or at least partially ) simple classifier on critical data and retrieving that in addition to the 50 - 50 chance of 1000 categories ( i. e. a factor of 26 ). in other words, you will have to label 5 ( i. e., 90 % ) from a machine learning project, thanks to a here and not so - you may be able to find relevant part of the force process.',\n","  'question:': 'What are some standard ways of computing the distance between documents?

'},\n"," '17491': {'actual:': \"Imho with only 2 months of data one big problem you will have is seasonality : pollution depends a lot on temperature and wind conditions, so in order to predict pollution level accurately you would need at the very least one year of data, preferably several past years. I don't think you can predict properly pollution level two months in advance with only two months of training data. Maybe you could try to make the problem broader : use a dataset including multiple cities with several years of data, then you can try to forecast pollution level in a particular location using features representing local conditions such as density, temperature, etc. Not enough karma to simply comment, so I have to log this as an answer. Does it make sense? Sure! But keep in mind that if you train your model on a single location, it can only really be trusted to be used on future data from that same location. Could your model generalize to other locations perhaps? Maybe, but your model didn't see anything so you can't be sure. Same thing applies to having only 2 months worth of data. You can't be sure if this model will be accurate when it's scoring data that comes from a month it hasn't seen before. If you really want to work on this type of problem and just don't have the data for it - this link has a similar dataset that might interest you.

I haven't kept up with the latest developments, but last I was aware, TPUs don't necessarily dominate over GPUs in all aspects. They may provide more compute per watt, but that's not the same as compute per unit or compute per dollar. More specific to the architecture details, google has it's own documentation on exactly what sorts of computation TPUs are good at, versus what is more suitable for a GPU.

'},\n"," '17896': {'actual:': \"With such a heavy imbalance and two classes ( it seems ) you could treat this as more of an outlier detection problem. You should read up on models and algorithms in that direction! If you go forward with a traditional classification you need to balance the data set, consider methods such as SMOTE. Depending on the size of your data I would generally recommend downsampling the majority class which avoids producing synthetic cases but advanced methods such as SMOTE basically take care of this decision for you. Can you elaborate what you mean with your first question as well? A classification algorithm needs 0 / 1 labels and therefore the output score cannot be ordered in the way that you mention. Some classification algorithms put out a probability score instead of predicted label so if this is what you mean I can tell you that the imbalance will still be a problem. Referring to a previous answer and a blog post ( which I'm aware is not that relevant since the data is more balanced than yours ), I think that your first approach should be without handling imbalance, and if you're happy with the results, no need to work towards balanced solutions. As in many ML topics, the best way is to try, I recommend you to adapt the experiment in the blog post to your data. However, a more specific answer to your question : I think that balancing usually messes the calibration of your classifiers on your training data, so if you needed calibrated predictions I would advocate for not using balancing. If you don't care about calibration, it is not that bad to balance. Under - sampling is better than over - sampling in my experience. The amount of under or over - sampling can be a hyperparameter to tune. Some Python Sklearn models have this option : class _ weight = balanced. By that, you specify to your algorithm your data are unbalanced, and it makes the changes by itself. You can try this on few models, I had a better result with this option than by using the Downsampling Majority Class technique in a same problem [SEP] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD] [PAD]

balancing? I am working with a really imbalanced dataset ($approx$ 1% of positive cases) for a classification problem. I know that class balancing is an important step in this scenario. I have two questions:  Considering that I don't want to put the 0/1 label, but just to order the record according to the output score (it is always a calibrated probability of being in the positive class), is it still a good idea to do class balancing or, considering the specific output required, it is useless? Basically, I do not care about the cut-off point, but I just sort the record in order to identify the one with a higher probability of being positives.  Considering the really small percentage of positive cases, is it better to do over/under sampling? Is there any rule-of-thumb to decide the proportion of resampling?

DNN A fully-connected DNN has layer sizes of 3-3-4-2, where the first layer size represents the input layer. We assume that all layers are affine ones (no ReLU). Give the dimensions of all weight matrices and all bias vectors in the network and compute the total number of free parameters in this DNN. According to this task the first layer size represents the input layer, so it must be 3. a(0) = x = 3  If I know the input layer, so 3-4-2 are also the sizes of the bias vectors. I know now the dimension of the input layer and the bias vector. The columns of W must be also 3, because of the size of the input layer. The rows of W must be equal to the size of the bias vector. So I computed the following dimensions: W(1) = W33, b3, a(1) = 3  W(2) = W43, b4, a(2) = 4  W(3) = W24, b2, a(3) = 2  But how to compute the total number of free parameters in this DNN? '},\n"," '18098': {'actual:': 'That is a common scenario in a learning to rank problem. One heuristic is to separately model explicit ( human - labeled ) and implicit ( user - behavior ) features. Then combine the separate feature groups with a learned weight for their final relative contribution. Improving Web Search Ranking by Incorporating User Behavior Information by Agichtein et al goes into greater detail. RankNet takes this approach using a neural network.

For one thing it is not clear what parameter the confidence interval that you calculated is for. In any case, some care is needed in the interpretation of ( frequentist ) confidence intervals. In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval is random, and the parameter that the interval is for is fixed. In the case of a 99 % interval this means that if the data were collected again, many times, and the confidence interval re - calculated each time, then 99 times out of 100 it would contain the true value of the parameter. This is the only technically correct interpretation of the frequentist confidence interval. It is often interpreted, incorrectly, as being an interval that contains the parameter with 99 % probability, and that appears to be the interpretation that you are using.

And then proceed to calculate the similarity scores and the gain for the new leaves and continue down our tree Here it seems like you are describing just a decision tree. Watch this tutorial to understand it a bit more My question is now say we had two or more features such as height, age, weight, education etc. How does the algorithm know where to break the initial residuals? Does it compute it over all possible features and finds the best gain? I can imagine for large datasets to go through all features, then break it at some threshold and compare must take a long time. Again you are talking about the decision tree and its complexity, but yes, for large datasets is overly computationally expensive. To avoid this several strategies are used, as sampling, feature selection or quantization Or does it start at some random feature and work its way down kind of like a random forest? I know there is a parameter within the algorithm that allows you to set the percentage of features per tree so adding on to my question once we specify this percentage how does it pick the features and more importantly once those features are picked how does it know which one to pick to break the initial leaf of residuals. The random forest does random feature selection per split of the tree. The trees are grown greedy, so it tries all possible splits and chooses the best.

to learning the XGBoost algorithm and had a question about how the algorithm knows which feature to break the tree on first. Here is my understanding (and please correct me if I'm wrong): Each tree starts as a single leaf and all of the residuals go to that leaf. Then we calculate the similarity score and try to split amongst some feature characteristics. For example, say we only had one feature - height. We could split the residual if its respective x-value was say height   $180cm$ or height   $180cm$. And then proceed to calculate the similarity scores and the gain for the new leaves and continue down our tree. My question is now say we had two or more features such as height, age, weight, education, etc. How does the algorithm know where to break the initial residuals? Does it compute it over all possible features and finds the best gain? I can imagine for large datasets to go through all features, then break it at some threshold and compare must take a long time. Or does it start at some random feature and work its way down kind of like a random forest? I know there is a parameter within the algorithm that allows you to set the percentage of features per tree so adding on to my question once we specify this percentage how does it pick the features and more importantly once those features are picked how does it know which one to pick to break the initial leaf of residuals. Edit: I tried reading the paper where the algorithm was first published but found it a bit too difficult to conceptualize and understand. \"},\n"," '18634': {'actual:': \"Gradient boosting machines can return values outside of the training range. Have a look at this post Can Boosted Trees predict below the minimum value of the training label? In practice this is unlikely to happen, but it can be the case for your data. If this is happening probably what it means is that your training data and the one you are evaluating are different. ( upgraded from comment to answer ) Since your target is a count variable, it's probably best to model this as a Poisson regression. xgboost accommodates that with objective ='count : poisson '. @ Cryo's suggestion to use a logarithmic transform is also worth trying, but you shouldn't just skip transforming the zeros : instead, use $ log ( 1 + Y ) $ or something similar. Note that when log - transforming, your error optimization will inherently be multiplicative : for a true value of 10, predicting 100 or 1 have the same wrongness.

values in XGBoost regression I am trying to perform regression using XGBoost. My dataset has all positive values but some of the predictions are negative. I read on this link that reducing the number of trees might help the situation. I reduced the estimators from 700 to 570 and the number of negative predictions decreased but is there any way to remove these negative predictions? When I further tried reducing the estimators to 400, I got worse results with high rmse and more negative predictions. I looked at the negative predictions to understand where the model went wrong(see below image):  It looks like if I take the absolute value of the negative predictions then that would be sufficient but is this the right method? My code is: !pip install xgboost !pip install scikit-optimize from xgboost import XGBRegressor  final_XGB=XGBRegressor(random_state=123,gamma= 24.47 ,learning_rate=0.1235,max_depth=10,min_child_weight=0.21509999999999999,                       n_estimators=570,subsample=0.74,reg_lambda=0.8)  from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate  cross_val_scores=cross_validate(final_XGB,X_train,y_train,cv=3,scoring=['neg_mean_squared_error','r2'],verbose=1,return_train_score=True,n_jobs=-1 )  cross_val_scores['test_r2'].mean() #returns 0.9595609470775659  EDIT: A bit more about the dataset. I am trying to predict the number of people that would be present at a given location at a given time period. In order to predict the count of people, I have taken the  hour of day, date, peak(is it a public holiday?), Weekend(1/0), Area (area of location in m2) location name.  The location names were string values (eg: Location1, Location2, etc.) so I transformed them using JamesSteinEncoder. There are no missing values and I have removed a few outliers from the dataset. Regarding the relationship between  Actual  and  Error  column, I have plotted the graph below:  Snapshot of final results:  \"},\n"," '1897': {'actual:': \"You could also try tSNE, also available in scikit - learn. It is a probabilistic dimensionality reduction technique, specifically designed for plotting data in two or three dimensions, while preserving the original distances between the samples as much as possible. You should be able to see how well your data is clustered. I just want to chime in and highlight that using clustering to segment your data before modelling might be a bad idea. At a high level, clustering is a two / three dimensional visualisation of similarity. If you have two / three dimensions to your dataset you're probably OK using clustering to segment your data as all the possible relationships are being visualised by the clustering. However if you have more than three variables than this you won't be able to visualise all the possible relationships meaning that using the 2D / 3D clustering might find patterns that are not there. See Steinbach, Ertz, and Kumar for more information. That being said you could use dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset to two / three dimensions and then cluster your population - but this is situational. By reducing the dimensionality of your dataset to get cluster - able results you might be throwing away information that would be useful when it comes to modelling. Also : I'd recommend using a more formalised metric for deciding the adequacy of your clustering see here - maybe you're using too many / not enough clusters? I've only answered your half of your question so now I'll attempt the second part : when in doubt, Random Forests are your best friend. Use them as your baseline prediction and you'll be getting great accuracy out of the box.

Anyway for your problem a clustering or even a classifier might help. If labels are assigned on the basis of a similarity metric ( and you have a good guess of what this metric might be ) you could use a clustering algorithm to impute the missing labels ( clustering is based on similarity between samples ). However if it's reasonable that samples can be similar according to different metrics ( and you are uncertain about it ) then a classifier might help - provided you have enough labeled data to train the classifier. Which approach works best will also depend on the number of labeled samples and number of features. Whichever strategy you choose to use the imputed labels will be noisy ( some samples will be mislabeled ).

to support a hypothesis. Is this a valid use-case for unsupervised ML? I have a dataset where some items have been labelled (categorized into 4 classes [A,B,C,D]). However, there is a vast majority of the dataset which has not been labelled. My hypothesis is that there are some characteristics which influence which category is applied to each item. Would clustering or maybe even a recommender system be able to suggest where each item should be placed? On a practical level, would I provide the  labels  within the model? Or would I keep it apart until the end and then overlay those labels on whatever the model managed to group together? The above example seems like a clustering use case. However, can I spin the problem into a recommender system? As in, you labelled item X as A, and it has characteristics 1,2,3... item Y has similar characteristics, maybe you should label it A as well? '},\n"," '19433': {'actual:': \"With complex data it's rare not to have any overfitting ( or underfitting ). Ideally one wants to avoid strong overfitting, and if given a choice between two models it's clearly safer to use one which isn't overfit. But if it's impossible to avoid, from a practical perspective there's no reason not to use a model for this reason, in my opinion. The problem with an overfit model is simply that it's going to perform poorly on fresh instances, so the worst that can happen is the performance that you observe on the test set. Just an idea : I don't know if it makes sense with your data but it might be worth trying one - class classification on the minority class. This could be a way to avoid the imbalance issue, and could be followed by a second stage of regular binary classification.

normally between zero and 2001. there are also more widely used techniques like regularization in neural networks. another idea is to use data augmentation to prevent overfitting. using it in a way it could be augmentation an important aspect of model training concepts. using as the neural nets is we are probably using transfer learning. in the wordnet is a problem where we train a neural network without any regularization. i suggest to use gridsearchcv to maximize the vencoder. notice how much you are doing is next stepwise normalization. here is an example where pca in boosting the variance to fs lead to overfitting. gans can be supposed to be the same as those where just telling the model to over fit extract some features. another approach that i haven't had good results to consider is using algorithmic transformations, where working with timeseries and split data from a balanced dataset and it is a bug in diagnose, so even that same model gets better. furthermore, a regularization method is an alternative to using parameters from lasso or elastic net\",\n","  'question:': \"Strong overfitting accompanying strong class imbalance I'm training an xgboost binary classification model. The data I have is around 600k and positive is only 0.1% of it. I tried to use all overfitting prevention techniques xgboost has to offer (tune eta, gamma, min_child_weight, subsample feature/data, early stopping etc). However, my model either strongly overfits but with decent metric on test set or does not overfit too strong but general performances are bad. I've listed two training results (metric is auc-pr) here,     AUC-PR 130 trees 3800 trees     train 0.18 0.98   test 0.05 0.45   validation(early stopping) 0.06 0.46     I checked for data leakage but doesn't seem to have any. My question is:  Can I use the model with 3800 trees, even though it's overfitting, it's getting decent results on test set? Do I absolutely have to be strict in preventing overfitting for this strong class imbalance scenario? If so, what are other techniques? Anything I did wrong?  \"},\n"," '19500': {'actual:': \"Method 2 : This is original batch Normalization as suggested in the paper [ Ioffe Szegedy, 2015 ]. It is the most common approach. It is very well explained here [ d2l. ai ] Similarly, with convolutional layers, we can apply batch normalization after the convolution and before the nonlinear activation function. When the convolution has multiple output channels, we need to carry out batch normalization for each of the outputs of these channels, and each channel has its own scale and shift parameters, both of which are scalars. Assume that our minibatches contain m examples and that for each channel, the output of the convolution has height p and width q. For convolutional layers, we carry out each batch normalization over the mpq elements per output channel simultaneously. Thus, we collect the values over all spatial locations when computing the mean and variance and consequently apply the same mean and variance within a given channel to normalize the value at each spatial location I'm not sure what the authors mean by per feature map, does this mean per channel? Yes, two trainable parameters per Channel / Feature map. Method 3 : This was the idea suggested as Layer Normalization. [ Paper ] It fixed the issue of BN i. e. dependence on a Batch of data and also it worked for sequence data. But the paper didn't claim anything great for CNN. We have also experimented with convolutional neural networks. In our preliminary experiments, we observed that layer normalization offers a speedup over the baseline model without normalization, but batch normalization outperforms the other methods. With fully connected layers, all the hidden units in a layer tend to make similar contributions to the final prediction and re - centering and rescaling the summed inputs to a layer works well. However, the assumption of similar contributions is no longer true for convolutional neural networks. The large number of the hidden units whose receptive fields lie near the boundary of the image are rarely turned on and thus have very different statistics from the rest of the hidden units within the same layer. We think further research is needed to make layer normalization work well in ConvNets Method 1 : This is averaging across the Feature Maps on every pixel. I am not sure of its aplication.

calculated the expected times. the easition coefficient is updating the random number of samples to decreasing grads ( or just a square of these where the gradient increases, but the two unchanged ). the frequently happens this average of gradients increases, the closer classical principal component of the error is itself equal to the real number of parameters. the indirectly comes from the definition of averaging ( very low example, community has no impact on the loss function, thus the proportion of correctly classified samples would be more significant and therefore have the same weight as number of individual others, in theory it gets deeper you are calculating the gradients across all nodes or less important of the variance. the image gets driven by summing the weighted average of all the gradients and thus makes every neuron more stable. however it is recommended to see an actual backprop is used here, that leads to a smaller stable gradient computation of the terms carefully, and thus the variance in the loss function is more likely to improve the other.',\n","  'question:': \"How does batch normalization work for convolutional neural networks I am trying to understand how batch normalization (BN) works in CNNs. Suppose I have a feature map tensor $T$ of shape $(N, C, H, W)$ where $N$ is the mini-batch size, $C$ is the number of channels, and $H,W$ is the spatial dimension of the tensor. Then it seems there could a few ways of going about this (where $gamma, beta$ are learned parameters for each BN layer) Method 1: $T_{n,c,x,y} :=  gamma*frac {T_{c,x,y} - mu_{x,y}} {sqrt{sigma^2_{x,y} + epsilon}} + beta$ where $mu_{x,y} = frac{1}{NC}sum_{n, c} T_{n,c,x,y}$ is the mean for all channels $c$ for each batch element $n$ at spatial location $x,y$ over the minibatch, and $sigma^2_{x,y} = frac{1}{NC} sum_{n, c} (T_{n, c,x,y}-mu_{c})^2$ is the variance of the minibatch for all channels $c$ at spatial location $x,y$. Method 2: $T_{n,c,x,y} :=  gamma*frac {T_{c,x,y} - mu_{c,x,y}} {sqrt{sigma^2_{c,x,y} + epsilon}} + beta$ where $mu_{c,x,y} = frac{1}{N}sum_{n} T_{n,c,x,y}$ is the mean for a specific channel $c$ for each batch element $n$ at spatial location $x,y$ over the minibatch, and $sigma^2_{c,x,y} = frac{1}{N} sum_{n} (T_{n, c,x,y}-mu_{c})^2$ is the variance of the minibatch for a channel $c$ at spatial location $x,y$. Method 3: For each channel $c$ we compute the mean/variance over the entire spatial values for $x,y$ and apply the formula as $T_{n, c,x,y} := gamma*frac {T_{n, c,x,y} - mu_{c}} {sqrt{sigma^2_{c} + epsilon}} + beta$, where now $mu_c = frac{1}{NHW} sum_{n,x,y} T_{n,c,x,y}$ and $sigma^2{_c} = frac{1}{NHW} sum_{n,x,y} (T_{n,c,x,y}-mu_c)^2 $ In practice which of these methods is used (if any) are correct for? The original paper on batch normalization , https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf , states on page 5 section 3.2, last paragraph, left side of the page:  For convolutional layers, we additionally want the normalization to obey the convolutional property  so that different elements of the same feature map, at different locations, are normalized in the same way. To achieve this, we jointly normalize all the activations in a minibatch, over all locations. In Alg. 1, we let $mathcal{B}$ be the set of all values in a feature map across both the elements of a mini-batch and spatial locations  so for a mini-batch of size $m$ and feature maps of size $p times q$, we use the effective mini-batch of size $m^prime = vert mathcal{B} vert = m cdot pq$. We learn a pair of parameters $gamma^{(k)}$ and $beta^{(k)}$ per feature map, rather than per activation. Alg. 2 is modified similarly, so that during inference the BN transform applies the same linear transformation to each activation in a given feature map.  I'm not sure what the authors mean by  per feature map , does this mean per channel? \"},\n"," '20170': {'actual:': 'If your objective is to convert non - normal data into something that looks more normal / gaussian - try the Box - Cox Transform here.

Calculate the feature importance for the top N best models in the leaderboard against the selected metric. You can calculate feature importance by measures such as permutation or shap impact. For each model with computed feature importance, get the ranking of the features. Compute the median rank of each feature by aggregating the ranks of the features across all models. Sort the aggregated list by the computed median rank. Define the threshold number of features to select. 6. Create a feature list based on the newly selected features. So basically you are going to have a matrix of shape ( n _ features, n _ models * ), whose values are going to be the rank of importance of feature i in model m for i in { 1,.., n _ features } and m in { 1,..., n _ models } * Note that you could also add as columns the importances given by SHAP or Permutation importance. Then you have to calculate the median ( or any other central tendency metric like mean ) row - wise, i. e. the median of the rank of importances for each feature across all models, so finally you are able to establish a threshold for which you are going to filter the feature set. This method has the advantage of being both an ensemble and model agnostic, since you are only using the rank of importances regardless of how that importance is being calculated for each method, but the disadvantage of defining an appropriate threshold.

Just look at this graph with the first three values : The correlation coefficient is coming out to be - 0. 9999525 considering the first three models only. Now if, others are included, then also it stays the same. Now coming to your answer, $ R ^ 2 $ tells us about the % of variance that can be explained by the model. Whereas, $ RMSE $ can tell us about how close our predictions were compared to the actual values. $ RMSE $ often gives a better estimate about the model but it suffers badly when there are outliers in the prediction. So, for that reason, I would suggest the following step before taking the final decision : Compute the $ MAD $ ( Median absolute deviation ) and $ MAPE $ ( Mean absolute percentage error ) and see how are they coming. $ MAPE $ also suffers if there are outliers in the model but we can get a better sense of the prediction as it takes the relative %. In short : I would look at more Statistical Error Estimators before selecting the best model. In addition, have a look at this paper, which I co - authored : Prediction of Responses in a Sustainable Dry Turning Operation : A Comparative Analysis Here, we have used 5 different statistical error estimators to select the best model. Another way to approach the problem is to take all of the trained models and compare each of their performances on the same hold - out dataset. This is the most common way to evaluate machine learning models. Choosing the evaluation metric to use depends on the goal of the project. Most machine learning projects care about predictive ability. R is not a useful metric for the predictive ability of a model. RMSE can be a useful metric of predictive ability. However, since the errors are squared is sensitive to the properties of the data. You mention that you are using different data. Those differences in data could impact comparing RMSE across different sources. Comparing different models on the same dataset would be better when using RMSE.

you are predicting missing values with the other dataset, then you should adapt the sequential model to the real world, one by not missing data. have you tried other regression techniques? could you add those records so that i would suggest starting the situation before yourself until your data is memorizing the nature of the data missing, you should standardize it before the learner reached the missing value. hence, if you drop rows missing data, you should only transform the missing data, or impute them with another attribute from the other dataset to the missing value. which method you leaner has already done with decision tree based models and inside imputation is a method tool that will handle missing values based on imputation. when you impute missing value scaling, your model seems to be missing completely at random, and that is somewhere in your scenario. unless you some data has missing values, you should impute the missing value up the missing values with some other values ( missing imputation, controlled values will come in the same distribution that your model wont on that same dataset ). the pattern would be in the case where missing data is missing and your provide the best result with models for imputation. i assume you mean these are the nan missing completely at random, but not the best solution. for the reason being missing these are the problem of imputing data with trying to impute. your provide missing values will be missing completely at the end if you have some kind of imputed data records with just described average and there's no reason you did not have this property to have got. in general imputation itself proposed some others, but this is too much more suited to test if you understand linear relationships, you will have to test if

The link I provided is a good starting point for learning about sentiment analysis. If this is what you are looking for, it is available as part of Stanford\\'s Core NLP. These doesn\\'t exist an absolute solution for the your question, but I can suggest you some techniques which may help. If I\\'m not wrong, then you\\'re basically trying to interpret the English language into human emotions. There are complete theories written on the subject, and after doing a little bit of research, I\\'ve come up with two things that might prove to be handy in your case. Affective Computing The main idea is, that you collect the verbal data ( as much as you can ), and you apply machine learning algorithms ( classification ) on the verbal data to figure out whether the verbal data is related to \" happiness \", or not. You can think of as many important features as you can. One feature can be, that you can assign a number to each word, like ( happy = 1, happier = 3, happiest = 10 )... this is just an example. Another feature can be, that you try to figure out \" nots \" and \" negations \" in your sentence, because \" not happy \" will obviously get you to a negative value in your feature. You can think of as many similar linguistic features as you can. After having a reasonable number of calculated features, you can simply apply the algorithms mentioned, and you may eventually get to a point. Sentiment Analyzer I just found this research paper, and it works with Natural Language Processing, and after processing the language, it analyzes the emotions of the person, or the source. You can go through the study by yourself. Why don\\'t you empirically derive happiness based upon a sampling of the population of your texts ( i. e. facebook comments ). You can recruit reviewers ( either \" naive \" participants or perhaps experts in psychology / emotion depending upon your needs ). Give reviewers some sort of scale to rate texts on - either classify texts as positive, negative, or neutral OR have them rate texts on a likert type scale, e. g., on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being max, how happy do you think this text is? ). By having multiple reviewers you can set thresholds for reliability thresholds ( e. g., 2 out of 3 reviewers must agree on assignment / score ; 2 reviewers come to consensus on disagreement, etc. ). This data then becomes your labelled training data that you can use to score your remaining data.

bayesian factor of the person. this might be a problem forression relationships. in practice, you could just apply a single probability distribution over the tokenized data across labels $ s $? this constrained distribution by replacing the parameters of the current and an output layer. this instance is a useful and hard problem, please correct me if you are working on something like the first groupby the identifier think of the length of the embeddings in the sequence. this might be a problem for you. besides seeing the fact that you are general annotated after the sound and challenges to require labeling each entity. some small sampling $ k $ times y $, the embedding for the index $ i $, you can adjust the followingtence on the unknown words before optimizing the likelihood ratio. since this is not specific to classification you may lose clusters, i would make sure you could apply an estimator to a latent model and then consider the token learned by this estimation. this hasn't been too hard to say : since you're not using the trained model in an online setting that relies on some initial tokenization ( e. g. somedicting factor $ ( n _ { t + 1 } : { 1. 0, rec { z } ) },..., the rank of the word $ ( metac { z }, hat { a } ) $ can be assumed to be negative than across the whole sentence, because this would probably make sense to annotate a simplification.\",\n","  'question:': \"Algorithm or formula to measure happiness? I am working on a project that takes in comments in a given Facebook page and determines the average happiness rating for it based on users of the page. My question is where would I find a formula, rating, or any other literature that would help me find a way to measure happiness using words and collections of words?  I'm looking for something similar to cosine similarity I suppose, but not to find similar words, but to find the average positivity or happiness related to a word or collection of words.  I'm not entirely sure this is the correct place for this question, but it has to do with data, and big data within Facebook so I am hoping to either get a question or be directed to somewhere that I may be able to find my answer.

data for a single data point, here you will end up with varying k - means twice as k - means. now aboutnns ( k - means ) rather than single data point. use your k - means algorithm designed for any special case where you start with the first point, you just have to find the first point in your k - 1 duplicates ( i. e. k - means ) and accept a new cluster say k - 1 duplicates, there is no need for any evaluation metrics, however 2 points don\\'t work well on this let\\'s just do now for all following : first clusteringstrain runs for all k = 3 b = 5, 000 k = 1 per iterations. get new

generalization. this is why most of the algorithms generalize in sparse data. binary in particular, during algorithm we use k - means, we don\\'t have complicated linear stability these many algorithms in their paper. some try the same code : you already have some solution to actually evaluation of the random sample scales - which can produce example more concrete, like collecting averages, divide distances between points in order to find the higher - dimensionality at the highest value, just keep 200 data points. it will be set to zero the same size and produce a different seed when the data is missing from its initial state value. it gives a high probability that two points are at the same distance [ because there is no noise or appear near each object ). i hope it could help your suggestion to expect maximize. he is still worth exploring a few points ( i looks late to check it and set it over your cluster the two left node and then find its \" imaginary cluster

modal averages. see chapter 3 of the related stack exchange research in coursera course, which explains fixed dendrogram has been broken as follows : cluster the data points from two clusters. it works very well in case you really can start by doing made the same assignments and then produce identically over anything and you want to use haversine. instead you dealt with the dendrogram points in order to find the best clustering. new vector new observations are generated both this subset. one is general rule, simply because you have some huge $ m $ cluster in both cases. k - means may be highly nonlinear ( such astmax medoids ), while k can find a good algorithm as also to visualize high silhouette scores for all cluster ones. those 2 can be clustered by directly calculating

case where one is missing, this is a pretty strong indicator that this was the case of dbscan clustering. some of algorithms based on a set of 4 clusters are close together. it won\\'t give very fast powerful and more robust to implementan such as lsomposition ( in case of complexity and implementation equal ). the second approach is that the clustering approach essentially reduces a threshold

How to calculate sum of all distances between one point and those $M$ points? Result is one number.  Now I have $N$ 2-dim points and same set of $M$ 2-dim data points as above. How to calculate sums of all distances between $N$ points and those $M$ points? It should be equivalent to looping through $N$ points and getting those sums. Result is $N$ numbers.   This problem relates to clustering. I extracted clusters from calibration data with kmeans, but now I want to identify to which cluster my new point(s) belong to. Of course, simple looping is inefficient. UPDATE: This is an R question. Mathematical formulation: $(x,y)_i$ is $N$-set, $(X,Y)_k$ is $M$-set. $$sum_{k=1}^M (x_i - X_k)^2 + (y_i - Y_k)^2 = d^2_i$$ UPDATE2: One of the methods I discovered is to split everything into two steps:  (calibration) identify clusters with some method like stats::kmeans(). It provides classes for the entire dataset. (backtesting) split dataset into train- and test-subsamples and use class::knn(). Cluster-IDs from train-subsample are assumed to be 'TRUE'. At the output it will deliver cluster-IDs identified by knn within test-subsample. test cluster-IDs are chosen with Euclidean metrics, exactly as I need.  Although I do not have control over the process it still delivers satisfactory result and speed. The realtime solution, where single point has to be classified, can be implemented with calibrated sample (after step 1). \"},\n"," '2198': {'actual:': 'Quality Certificates ( is \" for research use

There are 15 features in each instance and only 2 possible class values ( NEW,OLD). The problem is that there are only 725 OLD instances in the train set and 95 in the test.   The only algorithm which succeeds for me to handle imbalance is NaiveBayes in Weka (0.02 precision for OLD class), others (trees) classify each instance as NEW. What is the best approach to handle the imbalance and the appropriate algorithm in such a case?  Thank you in advance.

It can handle a large number of target classes, and is relatively fast to train, since you largely just calculate a bunch of univariate stats to plug into at prediction time. It won\\'t capture fancy interactions as much as a random forest though, so if you are concerned about \" they only buy shoelaces if they bought shoes but NOT shoeshine \" vs \" they often buy shoelaces if they\\'ve bought shoes \" then it may disappoint.

Classification with large number of categories I am making a recommendation system (kind of) and I have to recommend the item a user is most likely to buy in his next purchase. Doesn't matter if he already bought this item.  Given this, I'm treating this problem as a multiclass-classification problem with 4000 categories (number of different items users can buy).  Searching in Wikipedia I found this link and decided to use the One vs -rest method. So I decided to train one random forest for each item using as covariates flags if the user bought each item before (so I have around 4000 covariates). Then I will decide a rule to decide the recommended item (something like the one which has the largest probability to be bought or the largest lift.)  My problem is that it's taking too long to train (5 to 10 min per item):     5*4000 [1] 20000   20000/60 [1] 333.3333   333.3333/24 [1] 13.88889    So in the best case it would take 2 weeks to train.

'},\n"," '2484': {'actual:': \"Yes, if your 0. 85 AUC is good enough for your use case this is a good enough model. The performance on the training set indicates how well your model knows the training set. This we don't really care about, it's just what the model tries to optimize. The performance on the test set is an indication on how well your model generalizes. This is what we care about, and your model gets to around 0. 85 as an estimate for your generalization. Differences between training and testing are the norm and in this case it could be that you might get a better performance by adding stronger regularization but if 0. 85 is good enough, go for it! My first attempts [... ] gave me auc 0. 85 on test set and 0. 96 on training set. So, the model overfits. This is not quite true. See, ( almost ) each estimator will have a better prediction score on the training data than on the testing data. It doesn't mean each estimator overfit. It is normal though to habe a better score on the training set, as the estimator is built on it, meaning its parameters are fitted thanks to it. However, your estimator can fit your training data more or less. Let's take your Random - Forest example. If the depth is too high, you'll fit way to much to the training data : overfit. If the depth is not high enough, it will be hard to generalize to other data : you underfit. Underfitting : 0. 96 on train set 0. 82 on test set Possible good fitting : 0. 96 on train set 0. 89 on test set Overfitting : 0. 96 on train set 0. 75 on test set As a good data - scientist, you want your model to fit the data enough to generalize well but not too much not to overfit. To control how your model generalize, one uses cross - validation techniques. The value you get is pretty - much what you will obtain with new value the variance associated to this crossvalidation PS : Using cross - validation too often on test data makes you, in a way, learning this data as you choose them to maximize your test score. It can lead to a form of overfitting for future new data.

of dimensions, look via a convolutional network ( svd ). in the following way the array to possible $ x $ has to be a $ ( tests ) as $ l _ x $, so $ r $ can be taken separately $ theta ^ { ( 2 ) } $

usually possible to just one sparse matrix ( sep squared ) of repeating $ x $ has a map $ x $, notice the scalar value for each coordinate of $ x $. the average of a single vector is essentially the pseudo - epoch. the idea is to choose a differentiable $ x $ matrix, which takes $ m = ( x ^ txtheta ) = x $ so that it makes sense very frequently due to the fact that it is different. the fact that one or more processes in general apply to this objective is to apply a single backpropagation of the lstout38 $ z $ in a different computations. all of iterating hyperparameter $ x $ can be uncomputed by $ z = ( x _ 1, x _ m ) $ instead of $ x _ compre the tsonlon $ sharing a different $ x $ for each row of $ x $ itself. all you have is still taken separately as $ x _ i $ for each $ x $ and a different $ x _ j $ at $ t $. normally $ x _ j = x. $ y = x { batch x }, $ will give a higher importance $ f $. note that in the same way as $ x rightarrow y $, i. e. let\\'s say you got the same dimensionality of the input and the projection to the same ( and most common architecture ). in this case $ l $ can be anything 1 for each $ x _ m $ and each channel for a single $ x _ { new } $

represented as vectors from x and a multipro matrix : $ $ x = [ x $, a ] = sin ( x _ 1, x _ n ) $ $ ( x _ 1, x _ 1 ] $, where thetaining x has only two dimensions ( the same as each ), then moving the entire matrix ( let\\'s say one for each channel ). so you do out the dimensions ( ignore the entire matrix, along with simpler terms ). after all this architecture and small compared to working in standard cnn, you can find for a worked - - where multiplying the layers ( 1d ) or any dimensionality for each variable whose point takes only repeated vectors, $ x _ 1 $ ( denoted by only using some

I do have some experience with convolutional nets and traditional neural networks. I need to predict a probability distribution over one of the inputs of the next step. Most of my sequences are relatively short, with some big outliers in there. There is more than enough data so that should not be an issue.  I'm using Keras for this task, using either LSTM or GRU layers.  My input exists of sequences of categorical input $x_A$, $x_B$ and a few numerical values $x_1$ to $x_{11}$. I'm trrying to predict $x_A$ of the last step that is not trained on. For the high cardinality categorical features I'm using an embedding layer to map them to a dense space and then merge the three different types of input into one layer. My issue is merging them together before going to the softmax layer to do the one-hot encoding prediction of the last step. I cannot seem to get the inputs to match. I pad the shorter sequences to 10 steps plus the label and truncate the longer sequences cutting off the start. I've attempted both the Graph and the Sequential interface.  def build_graph_model(n_A, n_B, max_length, batch_size):     g = Graph()     g.add_input(name='A', input_shape=(max_length, ), dtype='int')     g.add_node(Embedding(n_A, 32, input_length=max_length, mask_zero=True), name='embedding_A', input='A')     g.add_input(name='B', input_shape=(max_length, ), dtype='int')     g.add_node(Embedding(n_B, 32, input_length=max_length, mask_zero=True), name='embedding_B', input='B')     g.add_input(name='rest', input_shape=(max_length, 11))     g.add_node(Dense(30, activation='relu'), name='rest_dense', input='rest')     g.add_node(LSTM(100), name='lstm', inputs=['embedding_A', 'embedding_B', 'rest_dense'])     g.add_node(Dense(n_dest, activation='softmax'), name='softm', input='lstm')     g.add_output(name='output', input='softm')     g.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])   This gives an assertion error for having the wrong input dimensions. If I remove the $x_1$ to $x_11$ thing completely it works. If I change the Dense layer into TimeDistributed(Dense) I still get the same error although I think that should work. Inserting the rest input directly into the merge doesn't work because the merge cannot be the first layer. I'm uncertain how to fix this issue.

You could be right, that using more features with a small data set increases sampling error and reduces the generalisation of the SVM model you are building. It is a valid concern, but you cannot say that for sure with only this worry and the training accuracy to look at. The usual solution to this is to keep some data aside to test your model. When you see a high training accuracy, but a low test accuracy, that is a classic sign of over - fitting. Often you are searching for the best hyper - parameters to your model. In your case you are trying to discover the best number of features to use. When you start to do that, you will need to make multiple tests in order to pick the best hyper - parameter values. At that point, a single test set becomes weaker measure of true generalisation ( because you have had several attempts and picked best value - just by selection process you will tend to over - estimate the generalisation ). So it is common practice to split the data three ways - training set, cross - validation set and test set. The cross - validation set is used to check accuracy as you change the parameters of your model, you pick the best results and then finally use the test set to measure accuracy of your best model. A common split ratio for this purpose is 60 / 20 / 20. Taking a pragmatic approach when using the train / cv / test split, it matters less that you are over or under fitting than simply getting the best result you can with your data and model class. You can use the feedback on whether you are over - fitting ( high training accuracy, low cv accuracy ) in order to change model parameters - increase regularisation when you are over - fitting for example. When there are a small number of examples, as in your case, then the cv accuracy measure is going to vary a lot depending on which items are in the cv set. This makes it hard to pick best hyper - params, because it may just be noise in the data that makes one choice better than another. To reduce the impact of this, you can use k - fold cross - validation - splitting your train / cv data multiple times and taking an average measure of the accuracy ( or whatever metric you want to maximise ). In your confusion matrices, there is no evidence of over - fitting. A training accuracy of 100 % * and testing accuracy of 93. 8 % are suggestive of some degree of over - fit, but the sample size is too low to read anything into it. You should bear in mind that balance between over - and under - fit is very narrow and most models will do one or the other to some degree. * A training accuracy of 100 % is nearly always suggestive of overfit. Matched with e. g. 99 % test accuracy, you may not be too concerned. The question is at worst \" could I do better by increasing regularisation a little \"? However, matched with ~ 60 % test accuracy it is clear you have actually overfit - even then you might be forced to accept the situation if that\\'s the best you could achieve after trying many different hyperparameter values ( including some attempts with increased regularisation ).

Let's say we want to regress house prices based on some features of a house. These three nodes could represent the rating of the neighborhood, the surface area and the number of bedrooms for example. Then you take a weighted sum to every of the hidden nodes. Every hidden node takes different weights over these features. The order you mention is per layer, since we need the output of the previous layer as input for the next one, these dependencies force this order. With regards to output, you can have a combined loss. In case of binary classification you would probably just have a sigmoid activation at the end, however if you would have multiclass classification you would have a softmax layer at the end, one output for every potential class. There are a lot of other things you could want to output, for example a bounding box so you would need coordinates of where the network thinks the box is, or even per pixel if it's part of the object or not, then you would have a m x n grid as output. EDIT : All the things you mentioned about the GPU etcetera, that is way too far for what this image represents. It's one network for one sample. I do agree it would have been better to just have one output node because most more basic examples in supervised learning have just 1 target.

unclear This image looks pretty familiar to anyone getting acquainted with neural networks, and on first glance it makes a lot of intuitive sense.      But on second, third, fourth, etc glance, some questions pop up! I hope I'm not the only one with these concerns.    There are 3 circles representing Input nodes. Does this mean that the data sent into the NN has to be separated into multiple batches? I don't hear much talk of that, or any kind of emphasis / reasoning. Why don't we send the data through the network all at once? Can't the video card handle it? (Or is that the reason why right there, that the card can't handle it?).    There are 4 circles representing Hidden nodes. Each previous node points to a Hidden one. The way this is show, it is confusing:    Does this mean that data coming in is somehow merged together? I see 3 arrows all coalescing together into the next layer. That's what it looks like visually.    Is there some order, or sequence here? There's no indication of this process happening in some order. It just looks like a mess of arrows pointing from Input to Hidden. Shouldn't be be concerned with the order in which these activations flow? After all, we are looking at a network graph.    There are 2 circles representing Output nodes. Is this showing that a NN can output 2 different sets of data?? Why do we want multiple outputs? We started with 3 blocks of data, now we have 2. How are 2 separate blocks of data going to help us make a binary choice on, say, image classification?    The more I look at this image, the more I dislike it. Yet I see it everywhere, in many introductory / intermediate discussions of NN. I'm hoping there is a reason why such an unclear image is so popular.  \"},\n"," '3042': {'actual:': 'I you want some kind of data - sets like Google spell checking data I suggest you look into the The WikEd Error Corpus dataset.

If you're going to use Spark I would lean towards higher memory counts if they're within budget. I'd also keep an eye towards more, lower cost nodes. A stack of Intel i7 NUCs ( or similar ) with 2TB consumer SSDs and 32GB of RAM will cost less than $ 1k per node and 10 - 15 of them could easily handle a class of 24 students. The bottleneck depends on the use pattern rather than the direct number of users. If people are doing high I / O workloads, then you wont get many people on at all. Whereas if you are doing small processes or just using it as a simple data lake, you could host the sort of people you're talking about there. Have you considered using AWS?

Since you want to give ranked recommendations to the users, a soft - max layer at the end will give you the probability of the phrase belonging to all the classes, so you can rank the labels in the order of the probability and suggest them to the user. Your first approach is the simplest and best given that you have finite data. I don't think it will be very scalable as your data grows. Also this approach will work best only when your phrases are so limited in their context and vocabulary. Using a convnet you can train on bigger and more ambiguous phrases and get good predictions.

Labels will be added by users to subset of the data initially and the system will help future users with existing labels.   The number of phrase-labels will be way less than then total number of phrase segments but more granular than topics/tags   I was thinking of the following approaches:   Do TF-IDF (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-feature-extraction.html) between input phrase segment and all the labeled phrase segments. By finding the most similar I can derive the labels that are best to be suggested Do TF-IDF between input phrase segment and all the phrase-labels.  Word2Vec??

Thanks :) '},\n"," '33': {'actual:': 'HDP is an extension of LDA, designed to address the case where the number of mixture components ( the number of \" topics \" in document - modeling terms ) is not known a priori. So that\\'s the reason why there\\'s a difference. Using LDA for document modeling, one treats each \" topic \" as a distribution of words in some known vocabulary. For each document a mixture of topics is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, and then each word in the document is an independent draw from that mixture ( that is, selecting a topic and then using it to generate a word ). For HDP ( applied to document modeling ), one also uses a Dirichlet process to capture the uncertainty in the number of topics. So a common base distribution is selected which represents the countably - infinite set of possible topics for the corpus, and then the finite distribution of topics for each document is sampled from this base distribution. As far as pros and cons, HDP has the advantage that the maximum number of topics can be unbounded and learned from the data rather than specified in advance. I suppose though it is more complicated to implement, and unnecessary in the case where a bounded number of topics is acceptable. Anecdotally, I\\'ve never been impressed with the output from hierarchical LDA. It just doesn\\'t seem to find an optimal level of granularity for choosing the number of topics. I\\'ve gotten much better results by running a few iterations of regular LDA, manually inspecting the topics it produced, deciding whether to increase or decrease the number of topics, and continue iterating until I get the granularity I\\'m looking for. Remember : hierarchical LDA can\\'t read your mind... it doesn\\'t know what you actually intend to use the topic modeling for. Just like with k - means clustering, you should choose the k that makes the most sense for your use case. I wanted to point out, since this is one of the top Google hits for this topic, that Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ), Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes ( HDP ), and hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( hLDA ) are all distinct models. LDA models documents as dirichlet mixtures of a fixed number of topics - chosen as a parameter of the model by the user - which are in turn dirichlet mixtures of words. This generates a flat, soft probabilistic clustering of terms into topics and documents into topics. HDP models topics as mixtures of words, much like LDA, but rather than documents being mixtures of a fixed number of topics, the number of topics is generated by a dirichlet process, resulting in the number of topics being a random variable as well. The \" hierarchical \" portion of the name refers to another level being added to the generative model ( the dirichlet process producing the number of topics ), not the topics themselves - the topics are still flat clusterings. hLDA, on the other hand, is an adaptation of LDA that models topics as mixtures of a new, distinct level of topics, drawn from dirichlet distributions and not processes. It still treats the number of topics as a hyperparameter, i. e., independent of the data. The difference is that the clustering is now hierarchical - it learns a clustering of the first set of topics themselves, giving a more general, abstract relationships between topics ( and hence, words and documents ). Think of it like clustering the stack exchanges into math, science, programming, history, etc. as opposed to clustering data science and cross validation into an abstract statistics and programming topic that shares some concepts with, say, software engineering, but the software engineering exchange is clustered on a more concrete level with the computer science exchange, and the similarity between all of the mentioned exchanges doesn\\'t appear as much until the upper layer of clusters. Actually HDP require a lot of hidden parameters, which are in code. If you play with such parameters you will get different results ( different topics ). People usually does not pay attention to such hidden parameters and thinks that model able to find such parameters. It is not true. User have to define parameters eta gamma and alpha and maximum of topics. If you specify max of topics say about 23 topics, then you model provide 23 topics in output. If you set up 15 topics then you get 15 topics in output. Yee Whye Teh et al\\'s 2005 paper Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes describes a nonparametric prior for grouped clustering problems. For example, the HDP helps in generalizing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to the case the number of topics in the data is discovered by the inference algorithm instead of being specified as a parameter of the model. Detailed explanation on Dirichlet Process can be found here Topic models promise to help summarize and organize large archives of texts that cannot be easily analyzed by hand. The Hierarchical Dirichlet process ( HDP ) is a powerful mixed - membership model for the unsupervised analysis of grouped data. Unlike its finite counterpart, latent Dirichlet allocation, the HDP topic model infers the number of topics from the data.

Thanks. \"},\n"," '3454': {'actual:': \"Define $ Z _ i = 1 [ Y _ i 0 ] $, i. e., $ Z _ i = 1 $ if $ Y _ i 0 $, else $ Z _ i = - 1 $. Now the data set $ ( X _ i, Z _ i ) $ defines a two - class boolean classification problem. The solution to that boolean classification problem with highest accuracy solves your original problem ( minimizes your loss function ). So, you are basically asking how to train a neural network to solve a two - class boolean classification problem. A reasonable approach is to put a softmax layer at the output of the neural network and train it using the cross - entropy loss, as usual. During test time, to pick a class, you pick whichever of the two classes has the higher likelihood output from the softmax stage. In other words, at training time, you look at the actual outputs ( continuous - valued ) from the softmax layer and use the cross - entropy ; at test time, you compare the two outputs and pick whichever is larger to choose the classification ( and apart from that ignore their exact values ). The shortcoming of this approach is that it doesn't take into account the value of the $ Y _ i $'s, only their sign. To improve this, use weights on the samples. We're again going to train a boolean classifier on the training set $ ( X _ i, Z _ i ) $, but this time we'll weight each sample in the training set differently. Put the weight $ Y _ i $ on the sample $ ( X _ i, Z _ i ) $ in your training set. In other words, when training the boolean classifier, the loss function will be a weighted sum of the loss for each sample : $ $ text { Loss } ( theta ) = sum _ i Y _ i cdot ell ( f _ theta ( X _ i ), Z _ i ) $ $ where $ theta $ are the model parameters, $ f _ theta ( X _ i ) $ is the output of the classifier on input $ X _ i $, and $ ell ( cdot, cdot ) $ is the cross - entropy loss. Notice that errors in samples where $ Y _ i $ is large are penalized more, and errors in samples where $ Y _ i $ is small are penalized less ; this is appropriate, as that's exactly what will happen when you use the classifier $ f _ theta $ to compute $ L ( f _ theta ) $. This should improve on the approach you're taking.

In the output volume, the $ d $ - th depth slice ( of size $ W _ 2 times H _ 2 $ ) is the result of performing a valid convolution of the $ d $ - th filter over the input volume with a stride of $ S $, and then offset by $ d $ - th bias. A common setting of the hyperparameters is $ F = 3, S = 1, P = 1 $. However, there are common conventions and rules of thumb that motivate these hyperparameters.

By using bagging, each DT is trained in a different data subset. Hence, is there any way of implementing an on-line random forest by adding more decision tress on new data?  For example, we have 10K samples and train 10 DT's. Then we get 1K samples, and instead of training again the full RF, we add a new DT. The prediction is done now by the Bayesian average of 10+1 DT's.  In addition, if we keep all the previous data, the new DT's can be trained mainly in the new data, where the probability of picking a sample is weighted depending how many times have been already picked. \"},\n"," '3965': {'actual:': \"You should try compensating for the imbalanced data and then can you try a lot of different classifiers.

Read this Quora answer to understand why memory bandwidth is the most important feature better : https : / / www. quora. com / Why - are - GPUs - well - suited - to - deep - learning. Tim has also given a \" theoretical \" rough comparison between GPUs based on their tech specs. You can also see that in his comparison 1080 Ti and TITAN X are roughly at the same performance level. Use 2 1080 Ti instead of a TITAN X since GTX 1080 Ti is definitely cheaper. I\\'ve personally evaluated the performance of 1080 Ti vs. TITAN X and they are roughly the same. Look at the CUDA compute capability. They are a mixture of hardware and software features a GPU has ( see guide ). I benchmarked the GTX 1070, Titan Black, GTX 970, GTX 980, GTX 980Ti. The numbers can be found in my masters thesis ( Table 5. 3 and Table 5. 16 ), but the gist is : GTX 1070 is by far the fastest GTX 980 and 980 Ti are pretty much the same, but only ~ half as fast as the GTX 1070, GTX 970 needs 1. 5 the time of the 980 You should look at how much memory you need.

For instance, let\\'s suppose you have a blog article in text format ( let\\'s call it filepath. txt for this example ). You decide that you wish to sort words into specific categories. For instance, you could categorise the keywords hotel, flights, countries, as travel, i. e. each incidence of the three words would be replaced with data. Let\\'s assume data is a relevant category of interest. Any article that would fall under a travel category would be included in your articles of interest. Using Python, you can then scan your file and use filedata. replace to replace your keywords with categories : # Read file with open (\\'filepath. txt \\',\\'r\\') as file : filedata = file. read ( ) # Replace keyword filedata = filedata. replace (\\'How \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'Why \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'of \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'to \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'you \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'all \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'and \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'be \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'a \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'for \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'in \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'is \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'the \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'about \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'an \\',\\'\\' ) filedata = filedata. replace (\\'Data \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'Python \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'R \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'machine \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'Linux \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'technology \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'flights \\',\\'travel\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'countries \\',\\'travel\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'hotel \\',\\'travel\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'analytics \\',\\'data\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'CNN \\',\\'news\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'weather \\',\\'news\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'Trump \\',\\'news\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'market \\',\\'business\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'entrepreneur \\',\\'business\\') filedata = filedata. replace (\\'financial \\',\\'business\\') # Write to file with open (\\'filepath2. txt \\',\\'w\\') as file : file. write ( filedata ) You could then use a library such as stringr in R to see how frequently the category ( which would have the keywords replaced with the category ) appears : require ( stringr ) WordList - str _ split ( readLines ( \" filepath2. txt \" ), pattern = \" \" ) searchqueries - sort ( table ( WordList ), decreasing = TRUE ) [ 1 : 100 ] searchqueries e. g. if the category appears X number of times or more, then the article is deemed relevant.

For example, in a perfect world I send it 230 articles of which 12 are returned as relevant based on previous training and testing articles. Assuming all 12 are relevant I save them to the training dir and recompile  to strengthen the model.

I was also reading how to implement a CNN for text classification but cannot seem to construct a basic conceptual framework for how to start with a few articles and adding to the training data every day to strengthen the model.  Is there a term for this type of strategy? Has it been done in some form on Kaggle, Github, etc? '},\n"," '4333': {'actual:': \"I have my own project that works similarly ( but much simpler model ), and it takes me about 0. 1s to run my predictions in real time. You did the right thing by re - using the session - - that's what I did too. My guess is that your bottleneck is the size of the model. As far as I'm aware, the Inception model is huge. There will always be a tradeoff between model complexity and runtime prediction speed. The Inception model is accurate, but no one ever said it was fast.

'question:': \"Tensorflow and OpenCV real-time classification I am testing the machine learning waters and used TS inception model to retrain the network to classify my desired objects.  Initially, my predictions were run on locally stored images and I realized that it took anywhere between 2-5 seconds to unpersist the graph from a file and around the same time to run the actual predictions.  Thereafter, I adapted my code to incorporate the camera feed from OpenCV but with the above noted times, video lags are inevitable.  A time hit was expected during initial graph load;  which is why initialSetup() is ran beforehand, but 2-5 seconds is just absurd. I feel like with my current application;  real-time classification, this is not the best way of loading it. Is there another way of doing this? I know with mobile versions TS recommends trimming down the graph. Would slimming it down be the way to go here? In case it matters my graph is currently 87.4MB  Along with this, is there a way of speeding up the prediction process?  import os import cv2 import timeit import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Loads label file, strips off carriage return label_lines = [line.rstrip() for line                in tf.gfile.GFile('retrained_labels.txt')]  def grabVideoFeed():     grabbed, frame = camera.read()     return frame if grabbed else None  def initialSetup():     os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'     start_time = timeit.default_timer()      # This takes 2-5 seconds to run     # Unpersists graph from file     with tf.gfile.FastGFile('retrained_graph.pb', 'rb') as f:         graph_def = tf.GraphDef()         graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())         tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')      print 'Took {} seconds to unpersist the graph'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)  def classify(image_data):     print '********* Session Start *********'      with tf.Session() as sess:         start_time = timeit.default_timer()          # Feed the image_data as input to the graph and get first prediction         softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_result:0')          print 'Tensor', softmax_tensor          print 'Took {} seconds to feed data to graph'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)          start_time = timeit.default_timer()          # This takes 2-5 seconds as well         predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'Mul:0': image_data})          print 'Took {} seconds to perform prediction'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)          start_time = timeit.default_timer()          # Sort to show labels of first prediction in order of confidence         top_k = predictions[0].argsort()[-len(predictions[0]):][::-1]          print 'Took {} seconds to sort the predictions'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)          for node_id in top_k:             human_string = label_lines[node_id]             score = predictions[0][node_id]             print('%s (score = %.5f)' % (human_string, score))          print '********* Session Ended *********'  initialSetup()  while True:     frame = grabVideoFeed()      if frame is None:         raise SystemError('Issue grabbing the frame')      frame = cv2.resize(frame, (299, 299), interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)      # adhere to TS graph input structure     numpy_frame = np.asarray(frame)     numpy_frame = cv2.normalize(numpy_frame.astype('float'), None, -0.5, .5, cv2.NORM_MINMAX)     numpy_final = np.expand_dims(numpy_frame, axis=0)      classify(numpy_final)      cv2.imshow('Main', frame)      if cv2.waitKey(1)   0xFF == ord('q'):         break  camera.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows()   EDIT 1  After debugging my code, I realized that session creation is a both resource and time consuming operation.  In the prior code, a new session was created for each OpenCV feed on top of running the predictions. Wrapping the OpenCV operations inside a single session provides a massive time improvement but this still adds a massive overhead on the initial run;  prediction takes 2-3 seconds. Afterwards, the prediction takes around 0.5s which makes the camera feed still laggy.  import os import cv2 import timeit import numpy as np import tensorflow as tf  camera = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Loads label file, strips off carriage return label_lines = [line.rstrip() for line                in tf.gfile.GFile('retrained_labels.txt')]  def grabVideoFeed():     grabbed, frame = camera.read()     return frame if grabbed else None  def initialSetup():     os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '2'     start_time = timeit.default_timer()      # This takes 2-5 seconds to run     # Unpersists graph from file     with tf.gfile.FastGFile('retrained_graph.pb', 'rb') as f:         graph_def = tf.GraphDef()         graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())         tf.import_graph_def(graph_def, name='')      print 'Took {} seconds to unpersist the graph'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)  initialSetup()  with tf.Session() as sess:     start_time = timeit.default_timer()      # Feed the image_data as input to the graph and get first prediction     softmax_tensor = sess.graph.get_tensor_by_name('final_result:0')      print 'Took {} seconds to feed data to graph'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)      while True:         frame = grabVideoFeed()          if frame is None:             raise SystemError('Issue grabbing the frame')          frame = cv2.resize(frame, (299, 299), interpolation=cv2.INTER_CUBIC)          cv2.imshow('Main', frame)          # adhere to TS graph input structure         numpy_frame = np.asarray(frame)         numpy_frame = cv2.normalize(numpy_frame.astype('float'), None, -0.5, .5, cv2.NORM_MINMAX)         numpy_final = np.expand_dims(numpy_frame, axis=0)          start_time = timeit.default_timer()          # This takes 2-5 seconds as well         predictions = sess.run(softmax_tensor, {'Mul:0': numpy_final})          print 'Took {} seconds to perform prediction'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)          start_time = timeit.default_timer()          # Sort to show labels of first prediction in order of confidence         top_k = predictions[0].argsort()[-len(predictions[0]):][::-1]          print 'Took {} seconds to sort the predictions'.format(timeit.default_timer() - start_time)          for node_id in top_k:             human_string = label_lines[node_id]             score = predictions[0][node_id]             print('%s (score = %.5f)' % (human_string, score))          print '********* Session Ended *********'          if cv2.waitKey(1)   0xFF == ord('q'):             sess.close()             break  camera.release() cv2.destroyAllWindows()   EDIT 2  After fiddling around, I stumbled into graph quantization and graph transformation and these were the attained results.

There\\'s some discussion of the issue ( and a workaround ), on the FastText Github page. In short, you\\'ll have to load the text format ( available at https : / / github. com / facebookresearch / fastText / blob / master / pretrained - vectors. md ). Once you\\'ve loaded the text format, you can use Gensim to save it in binary format, which will dramatically reduce the model size, and speed up future loading. https : / / github. com / facebookresearch / fastText / issues / 171 # issuecomment - 294295302 For. bin use : load _ fasttext _ format ( ) ( this typically contains full model with parameters, ngrams, etc ). For. vec use : load _ word2vec _ format ( this contains ONLY word - vectors - > no ngrams + you can\\'t update an model ). Note : : If you are facing issues with the memory or you are not able to load. bin models, then check the pyfasttext model for the same. Credits : Ivan Menshikh ( Gensim Maintainer ) Update 04 / 2020 load _ fasttext _ format ( ) is now deprecated, the updated way is to load the models is with gensim. models. fasttext. load _ facebook _ model ( ) or gensim. models. fasttext. load _ facebook _ vectors ( ) for binaries and vecs respectively. For example : from gensim. models. fasttext import load _ facebook _ model wv = load _ facebook _ model (\\'path _ to. bin. gz\\') I really wanted to use gensim, but ultimately found that using the native fasttext library worked out better for me. The following code you can copy / paste into google colab and will work, out of the box : pip install fasttext import fasttext. util fasttext. util. download _ model (\\'en \\', if _ exists =\\'ignore\\') # English ft = fasttext. load _ model (\\'cc. en. 300. bin\\') Works for out of vocab words too : ft. get _ word _ vector ( \" another \" ) ft. get _ word _ vector ( \" dkjeri37id20hnd

at least that said, it is not the same information to any other events or by chance to represent the data. this is why the authors understand this is made by chance, even if we have a hard - coded system ( this is exactly what any machine learning game based on intuitively - code this information is exactly what you have seen in the input. in other words, there's simply a convolutional neural network that would be represented by a factor of feature engineering, but there is no need to be able to know. my goal is to understand that there is no need for an individual instance beforehand : enough predicting a single point gets would be mat matters. as far as i understand, it might be important to noticemr phrases as a bigger factor of 1024a ; genericly you would be wanting to explore them, but that's an easily stack exchange python question.\",\n","  'question:': 'Data Augmentation for Regression I want to use deep learning for regression. However, the number of training samples is not large. In image processing, some new samples are generated on the basis of initial data through tasks like rotation to increase the number of data sets. Can I know if there is any algorithm to generate more data based on current samples (data augmentation for regression)? '},\n"," '5180': {'actual:': 'Scaling Standardize you data by $ ( x - mean ( x ) ) / std ( x ) $ Most K - mean implementation by default uses Euclidean distance which assumes the equal importance of all features. This requires proper scaling to prevent one action dominates the others. Dimensionality K - mean is not robust against the curse of dimensionality ( see this post ). So as always it good to reduce you dimensionality before feed it to the algorithm. Do some feature engineering first. For example, login and page load can be group together as a measure of passive engagement, page edit and page created could be considered as a single activate engagement feature.

One to approximate the $ X $, another to approximate the $ dX / dt $. The first step is easy. You have samples of input and target for $ X $. Just follow the normal process to train you network to learn $ X $ For the second step is that you don't have the target values ( i. e. gradient ) directly. The trick is that you already got an approximator for $ X $ from the first step, so use that to get your target for the second network.

\"Xyperparameter is a useful method of hyperparameters of data that you use to improve the size of hyperparameters for your algorithm. for applied resampling for feature selection, you'll combine lstm _ search _ at each iteration, allowing you to based on how the results are utilized. typically the results are different, times, the number of nodes of your grid does the shrinkage, and the number of jobs chosen by the number of samples in each combination. describe the data first and as i suppose your data is parallelized without replacement, exists one value per label. for example, if your data set is 6. 8, you get only 4 random samples, and you might want to divide this into three different dimensions. it is not feasible in your case where you have a huge dataset and want to rewrite your dataset into a smaller combine team, history with many different mini - batches and each time do the regression on a subset of data. something like over - sampling is a problem outside the reduction, performanceter... but the same algorithm can happen gradually. i hope this answered gives a similar explanation of how it works answers.\",\n","  'question:': \"Using standard ML models for modeling a derivative when the data set only contains function values I want to model a process that is a function of time, $X(t)$. I have a data set which corresponds to a coarse sampling of the function values $X$ at different time points, $t_1, t_2, ...$. I have a analytic-derived model for the derivative $frac{dX}{dt}$ = $F(X(t),G(t))$ which has a couple tunable parameters in the (known) functions $F$ and $G$. I've been able to tune these models with the following process:   Chose a set of parameters for the functions $F$ and $G$. Do a forward-Euler method from the earliest time in my data set to the ending point in my data set, generating the $X(t)$ which corresponds to the above parameters in $F$ and $G$. Use this $X(t)$, along with my measured data points to generate a model error. Use the above modeled error to go back to (1), iterating and doing an optimization over the parameters in the expression for $frac{dX}{dt}$ to minimize the error.   Note that in the above I have to deal with the function itself and not the derivative because my measured data is on a coarser time grid than the derivative needs to be computed. For example, my derivative changes meaningfully on a scale of $Delta t$, but my data set might only have points every $5Delta t$ to $10 Delta t$. I cannot take the function values themselves from the data set and create a derivative myself because of this discrepancy in the time scales.  Now this process works pretty well, and I'm able to achieve a pretty good error. However, I'm wondering if there's a better way to model the derivative $frac{dX}{dt}$ than this analytic model. For example, would a neural network or a regression tree be able to do a better job?  My question is, how would I do this in a computationally efficient way? Let's take a neural network as an example. I'm used to having inputs and their associated outputs when training a NN with standard packages. But the problem is, if I want to model the derivative, I don't have the derivative as an output to train on. I only know the function values and have only been able to compute a error to minimize on through the forward Euler integration. Of course I could treat the NN parameters as I did with the parameters above, and do a brute force minimization on them, but I obviously lose a lot of the efficiency of backprop in doing so (or, if I was doing this with a decision tree, would lose the logic of how regression trees are normally optimized).  Is there a better way for me to do this? Are there methods that exist to handle this problem? If anyone could point me in a fruitful direction it would be much appreciated.  \"},\n"," '5272': {'actual:': \"I'm curious what other people will say, but one option is to use KL - divergence. If your two histograms have the same x - axis, you can divide every column by the total count to convert counts to proportions. Then you could treat the histograms as probability mass, and use the KL - divergence. KL - divergence is really a measure of the distance between two probability distributions, but histograms are an approximation of a discrete distribution. You'd pick one of your distributions to be P and one to be Q, then calculate $ - sum _ x P ( X ) log { frac { P ( X ) } { Q ( X ) } } $ where $ x $ is each bin on the x - axis of the histogram. Be aware that this distance metric is directional, meaning you'll get a different answer if you swap P and Q. The reason is that the KL - divergence is a measure of information transfer ( like, the information you gain by moving from Q to P ), but I think that's irrelevant to your question.

\"reliable rule learning\", i.e. mining a set of rules with a very low number of false negatives. I recently read the paper \"Reliable agnostic learning\" by Kalai et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.026) and they basically describe what I want: Rules are determined to reliably classify data points, and the reliability is partly reached by allowing \"I don\\'t know\" as an additional answer. Sadly, their paper is purely theoretical and I could not find a corresponding implementation. Is there an implementation of reliable rule learning or a similar algorithm? At best, open source and Java-based? '},\n"," '53': {'actual:': \"Your system isn't just trained on items that are recommended right? if so you have a big feedback loop here. You want to learn from all clicks / views, I hope. You suggest that not - looking at an item is a negative signal. I strongly suggest you don't treat it that way. Not interacting with something is almost always best treated as no information. If you have an explicit signal that indicates a dislike, like a down vote ( or, maybe watched 10 seconds of a video and stopped ), maybe that's valid. I would not construe this input as rating - like data. ( Although in your case, you may get away with it. ) Instead think of them as weights, which is exactly the treatment in the Hu Koren Volinsky paper on ALS that @ Trey mentions in a comment. This lets you record relative strength of positive / negative interactions. Finally I would note that this paper, while is very likely to be what you're looking for, does not provide for negative weights. It is simple to extend in this way. If you get that far I can point you to the easy extension, which exists already in two implementations that I know of, in Spark and Oryx.

implicit data in recommendation A recommendation system keeps a log of what recommendations have been made to a particular user and whether that user accepts the recommendation. It\\'s like  user_id item_id result 1       4       1 1       7       -1 5       19      1 5       80      1   where 1 means the user accepted the recommendation while -1 means the user did not respond to the recommendation.   Question: If I am going to make recommendations to a bunch of users based on the kind of log described above, and I want to maximize MAP@3 scores, how should I deal with the implicit data (1 or -1)?  My idea is to treat 1 and -1 as ratings, and predict the rating using factorization machines-type algorithms. But this does not seem right, given the asymmetry of the implicit data (-1 does not mean the user does not like the recommendation).  Edit 1 Let us think about it in the context of a matrix factorization approach. If we treat -1 and 1 as ratings, there will be some problem. For example, user 1 likes movie A which scores high in one factor (e.g. having glorious background music) in the latent factor space. The system recommends movie B which also scores high in \"glorious background music\", but for some reason user 1 is too busy to look into the recommendation, and we have a -1 rating movie B. If we just treat 1 or -1 equally, then the system might be discouraged to recommend movie with glorious BGM to user 1 while user 1 still loves movie with glorious BGM. I think this situation is to be avoided.

new to deep learning and LSTM (with keras). I am trying to solve a multi-step ahead time series prediction. I have 3 time series: A, B and C and I want to predict the values of C. I am training an LSTM feeding 3 steps back data points to predict the next 3 steps in the future.  The input data looks like:  X = [[[A0, B0, C0],[A1, B1, C1],[A2, B2, C2]],[[ ...]]]   with dimensions: (1000, 3, 3). The output is:  y = [[C3, C4, C5],[C4, C5, C6],...]   with dimensions: (1000, 3).  I am using a simple LSTM with 1 hidden layer (50 neurons). I set up an LSTM with keras as:  n_features = 3 neurons = 50 ahead = 3 model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(input_dim=n_features, output_dim=neurons)) model.add(Dropout(.2)) model.add(Dense(input_dim=neurons, output_dim=ahead)) model.add(Activation('linear')) model.compile(loss='mae', optimizer='adam') model.fit(X, y, epochs=50)   This model works fine. Now, I'd like to predict the values of B as well (using the same input). So I tried to reshape the output in a similar way as I did for the training that has multiple features:   y = [[[B3, C3],[B4, C4],[B5, C5]],[[ ...]]]   so that it has dimensions: (1000, 3, 2). However, this gives me an error:  Error when checking target: expected activation_5 to have 2 dimensions,  but got array with shape (1000, 3, 2)   I guess the structure of the network needs to change. I tried to modify model.add(Dense(input_dim=neurons, output_dim=ahead)) with no success. Should I reshape the y differently? Is the structure of the network wrong? \"},\n"," '5308': {'actual:': \"Foremost, we must understand what is clustering. It is an unsupervised algorithm, applicable to scenario's where the target class is unknown. So essentially it's a data preprocessing algorithm. Continuing further, cluster analysis, helps in detecting patterns in data. Now, to detect patterns in data, one must ensure the sample consist of statistically significant variables. To find such significant variables, we need to perform various data preprocessing tasks like outlier, missing value ('s ), correlation and dimensionality reduction detection and treatment. Post, performing these steps, the noise from the data would be removed and one would be able to reveal the signal. Otherwise, one can perform the principal component analysis ( pca ) to detect the signal. This signal ('s ), can then aid in determining the true patterns or clusters in the data. Now, coming to the second part of the question. You can use the kernlab package in R to calculate the kernel. Perhaps these posts can help you further, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Aleksandar Blekh has given some really nice links about the big picture of how to do sentiment analysis ; I\\'ll try to provide some links to software and talk about the nitty - gritty of how to make it work. I\\'ll point you to the example using scikit - learn ( http : / / scikit - learn. org / stable / ), a machine learning library in Python. You would first want to take your dataset and load it into scikit - learn in a sparse format. This link ( http : / / scikit - learn. org / stable / tutorial / text _ analytics / working _ with _ text _ data. html ) gives examples of how to load text in a bag - of - words representation, and the same module ( scikit - learn. feature _ extraction. text ) can also count n - grams. It then describes how to run Naive Bayes and SVM on that dataset. You can take that example and start playing with it.

'},\n"," '5757': {'actual:': \"Great question. I'd say you should either use fourier transforms or sine / cosine transforms as they should get 0 to be right next to 23. The below post is talking about transforming day features, but should be easily applicable here. Transforming day features Transforming hour features Notice that if you want to establish an order relation that is cyclic you end up with a contradiction. In fact, you get : 0 : 00 23 : 59 0 : 00. If you just want to compute distances and you give up with continuity you might proceed as follows. First, you transform the domain hh : mm in minutes and then linearly map into an integer number between 0 and $ 2 ^ k - 1 $. The transformation function might be $ $ f ( h, m ) = mathrm { round } left ( frac { 60h + m } { 60cdot23 + 59 } times ( 2 ^ k - 1 ) right ) $ $ You can choose $ k = 10 $. It may be better to use less bits than those required to exactly represent time ( exact time requires 11 bit if seconds are not used, but not all $ 2 ^ { 11 } $ configurations are used ). Then, you encode $ f ( h, m ) $ with a Gray code. Gray code assure that consecutive numbers are encoded in a way that at most one bit is changed ; also, the code is cyclic in the sense that the encoding of $ 0 $ and the encoding of $ 2 ^ k - 1 $ differ of one bit only. Finally, you can evaluate the distance between two time instants through bitwise Hamming distance, which counts the number of different bit between two codes. If you want more precision, you might use seconds accordingly.

Suppose I have data with X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test given. As it is a classification problem I want to use XGBoost.   The issue is that there are more than 300 features.   I have found online that there are ways to find features which are important. But as I have lot of features it's causing an issue.  My current code is below. How can I modify it to say select top n ( n = 20) features and use them for training the model. I tried sorting the features based on importance but it doesn't work.      import xgboost as xgb     gbm = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=3, n_estimators=300, learning_rate=0.05).fit(X_train,y_train)     predictions = gbm.predict(X_test)  \"},\n"," '6306': {'actual:': \"You're going to have to do some experimenting to figure out what is'best ', but I would recommend starting with a convolutional neural network. Since you're only detecting a very small difference, though, the pixel values themselves should give you a good indication of where the colour is, and whether there is colour at all. I'm a bit surprised that a simpler architecture hasn't given you any luck. Based on the given Example If they are literally the same everywhere except in a small region, just subtract image 1 from image 2 to find the differences... And then we can check the positive and negative values where they are differing by a considerable margin to classify them This Will ( Probably ) Work... Have you tried rule - based approaches? Based on your example, I can think of two ways : For each picture, get a list of all RGB values it contains. The first contains only grays ( which have RGB values ( x, x, x ) ), the second one contains color ( so some pixel with RGB value ( x, y, z ), where $ x neq y $ or $ y neq z $ ). Or - if that is faster - convert all pictures to gray scale and check if the converted picture is identical to the original. Scan the image for areas ( larger than one pixel ) with identical colors. If your dots are large enough and the background noise is uncorrelated for neighboring pixels, it is very likely that these areas are the dots you are looking for.

The speckle pattern, in this context, is the same as a random pattern or \"white noise\" image. So these images are fundamentally different.  In group one, each figure is generated by considering a random function that returns something similar to a speckle pattern (see fig. 1). In group two we follow the same procedure as group 1, but we plot a small point above that can be positioned anywhere and with any color (see fig. 2).  I want to classify both groups and I already tried to do it with simple neural networks, but I have been unsuccessful.  What is the best technique for this kind of problems?

Given this, there are many options to handle outliers. Without taking a look at your specific data, it could be that this outlier represents a total? Perhaps the data source you have included totals, which should be removed. Generally, figuring out what to do with outliers requires investigating the outlier. If the outlier is a data processing or entry error, it can generally be removed, or replaced with say, the mean ( without the outlier ). If errors have been ruled out think about whether the outlier could be a legitimate value? There are no Right or Wrong answer. Instead, documentation of your decisions is really important. I'd suggest running your models with the outlier, and without, comparing the results and document any decision to remove or transform the outlier. Depending on your purpose, it should become relatively clear as to whether the outlier should be removed, eg if you're visualising the data, removing the outlier will likely have more a meaningful impact than retaining it.

tail in both training and test data sets. I found that if you remove the highest 1% of the value in both train and test data set for this variable, then the histogram of this variable in train and test data set looks pretty much the same. See the following figure.   My question is: I still need to use the training data (with both features and labels) to make predictions on the test data (with features only). In this case, how should I deal with this feature variable? I was thinking about removing the top 1% data in both training and test data set, but as I still need to make predictions on that 1% test data, so this is not a good idea I guess. In this example, as the empirical distribution of this variable in both training and test data sets look the same before and after removing the \"outlier\", should we just leave this variable unchanged? Also, in general, how should we handle the outlier before we put the feature into the machine learning algorithm?

The radial basis function ( RBF ) kernel is a good starting choice because most data are not linearly separable. Fortunately training an SVM is fast, so brute - forcing the kernel search is not a terrible method. For selecting the C and gamma values, we generally use a grid search : Every cell in the graph represents a SVM model trained on your data given the respective C and gamma parameters. The color represents its accuracy depicted by the scale on the right. Note that our scales are logarithmic, so we are able to search a broad solution space while only training 169 models. From this example, we can predict that the optimal ( C, gamma ) value combination would be in the region around $ ( 10, 0. 1 ) $ or $ ( 10 ^ { 10 }, 1e ^ { - 7 } ) $ We can further refine our C and gamma parameters by \" zooming \" into the regions with greatest validation accuracy. In other words, we can repeat the grid search with finer granularity and with boundaries determined by the regions of interest until we find the optimal C / gamma combination.

'},\n"," '6690': {'actual:': 'Gibbs sampling is an example for the more general Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to sample from distribution in a high - dimensional space. To explain this, I will first have to introduce the term state space. Recall that a Boltzmann machine is built out of binary units, i. e. every unit can be in one of two states - say 0 and 1. The overall state of the network is then specified by the state for every unit, i. e. the states of the network can be described as points in the space $ { 0, 1 } ^ N $, where N is the number of units in the network. This point is called the state space. Now, on that state space, we can define a probability distribution. The details are not so important, but what you essentially do is that you define energy for every state and turn that into a probability distribution using a Boltzmann distribution. Thus there will be states that are likely and other states that are less likely. A Gibbs sampler is now a procedure to produce a sample, i. e. a sequence $ X _ n $ of states such that, roughly speaking, the distribution of these states across the state space reflects the probability distribution. Thus you want most of the $ X _ n $ to be in regions of the state space with high probability ( and low energy ), and few of them to be in regions with low probability ( and high energy ). To do this, a naive Gibbs sampling approach would proceed as follows. You start with some state $ X _ 0 $. To find the state $ X _ 1 $, you would pick some unit and calculate the conditional probability for that unit to be in state 1 ( \" on \" ) conditional on the current value of all other units. Call this number p. You would then set the unit to 1 with probability p and pick the next unit to repeat this to get from $ X _ 1 $ to $ X _ 2 $ and so forth. In the special case of a restricted Boltzmann machine, this can be greatly simplified. Instead of going through, say, first all hidden units and then all visible units and update them like this one by one, you can, in fact, update all hidden units in one step and all visible units in one step, because any two hidden units and any two visible units are independent. Thus, for a full cycle through all units of the state space, you would : calculate the probability for all hidden units to be 1, given the value of the visible units set the hidden units to 1 with this probability calculate the probability for the visible units to be 1, again conditional on the value of the hidden units, and set the visible units to 1 with this probability This constitutes one full Gibbs sampling step and is your step 1 + the first part of 3 ( the second part is then needed for the further calculation and not part of the sampling ). The reason why we do this in the CD algorithm is that we actually want to approximate an expectation value and use a sampler for this. This is a complex topic and hard to summarize in a few sentences. If you want to learn more about the mathematics behind this ( Markov chains ) and on the application to RBMs ( contrastive divergence and persistent contrastive divergence ), you might find this and this document helpful - these are some notes that I put together while learning about this.

Compute the outer product of v and h and call this the positive gradient. From h, sample a reconstruction v' of the visible units, then resample the hidden activations h' from this. (Gibbs sampling step) Compute the outer product of v' and h' and call this the negative gradient. ...   I dont understand step 3 and Im struggling to grasp the concept of Gibbs sampling.

The algorithm you should use depends on the type of features you have. With numerical features you can use distance - based clustering techniques like k - means, or dimensionality reduction techniques like Self - Organizing Maps or t - SNE Basically, it depends on what kind of data you have and how many samples.

But I am getting the following error:  ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (60002,39) (38,) during pca.transform  Can someone please point out what I am doing wrong? When I use the training data itself as testing data, and do not remove the target variable from the dataframe, the program runs just fine. When I use the actual testing data, that does not have any target column, this error is thrown.  I have just started with ML, so please excuse if this question appears a bit too naive. Thanks! '},\n"," '6997': {'actual:': \"How about a weighted log - loss? Lets say we have $ m $ classes $ c _ 1, dots, c _ m $. We can give each class $ c _ i $ a weight $ w _ i $ which is inversely proportional to the percentage of the dataset that belongs to $ c _ i $. Then, the loss for some data set with actual classes $ y = y _ 1, dots, y _ n $ and predictions $ hat { y } = hat { y } _ 1, dots, hat { y } _ n $ can be defined as $ $ text { loss } ( y, hat { y } ) = frac { 1 } { mn } sum _ { j = 1 } ^ nsum _ { i = 1 } ^ m w _ i { I } _ { ( y _ j = = i ) } text { log } ( hat { y } _ j ) $ $ where $ { I } _ { ( y _ j = = i ) } $ is an indicator function which evaluates to 1 if $ y _ j = = i $ and 0 otherwise. One disadvantage is that it's not immediately obvious, given some value of the loss function, how good a particular value of the loss function is. However, it is easy to compare two values ( lower is better ). You have to use F1 score. A simple solution for that is to use confusion matrix. The way you can find F1 score for each class is simple. your true labels for each class can be considered as true predictions and the rest which are classified wrongly as the other classes should be added to specify the number of false predictions. For each class, you can find the F1 score. For more details take a look at F1 - score per class for multi - class classification. You can take a look at this implementation. In https : / / www. sciencedirect. com / science / article / pii / S004896971831163X? via % 3Dihub, we have used the product of the sensitivity of class i ( i. e., the ratio of data correctly classified for class i ) obtained for each class. This summarizes these values into a single index, which ranges between 0 and 1 and to some extent is irrespective to data imbalance. This approach induces a good balance between the error comitted to each category because any value appreciably below 1 reduces significantly the performance. To relax this allowing a greater error in 1 o more categories you can simply use ( in increasing order ) : the min, the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean. In https : / / ieeexplore. ieee. org / document / 6940273 / and https : / / ieeexplore. ieee. org / abstract / document / 5428802 / you can find these alternatives. Good luck. Rafael.

classifiers, one possibility could be to use argmaxyrsed classifier since there's no guarantee at all. however if you want a confidence with probabilities, it will take it differently.\",\n","  'question:': 'Evaluation methods for multi-class classification I am looking for single-number evaluation method that can be used in multi-class classification tasks that take into account imbalanced data-sets. For instance, ROC-AUC defined by binary classifiers, is a single-number and takes into account imbalanced data-sets. On the other hand, accuracy is single-number, defined for multi-class classifiers and does not take into account imbalanced data-sets. Finally, the confusion matrix is defined for multi-class, takes that into account but is not single-number. Is there any evaluation method that satisfies the three conditions?

If SVD is too slow / too memory consuming, then there are still some options : CUR - decomposition : a variant of singular - value decomposition that keeps the matrices of the decomposition sparse if the original matrix is sparse ( see : this chapter of Mining Massive Datasets book ) Random projections : projecting the data onto a random lower - dimensional subspace ( see : the Random projection in dimensionality reduction : Applications to image and text data paper ) Coresets : Given a matrix A, a coreset C is defined as a weighted subset of rows of A such that the sum of squared distances from any given k - dimensional subspace to the rows of A is approximately the same as the sum of squared weighted distances to the rows in C see the Dimensionality Reduction of Massive Sparse Datasets Using Coresets paper ) That's the tip of an iceberg. More approaches are there in the wild. The problem is that I doubt any of these solutions come with Weka ( please, correct me if I am wrong on this ). I would search for a usable Java implementation of any of these algorithms and try to port it to work with Weka's arff files.

If not, apologies!  I'm currently working with huge amounts of feature-value vectors. There are millions of these vectors (up to 20 million possibly).

Because most classifiers do not handle string data as values, I convert them to binary frequency values, so an attribute looks like this:  @attribute 'feature#value' numeric   And per row, the value is either 1 or it is absent (so note it's a sparse ARFF file).

I'm really curious as to what you would consider a suitable one (preferably unsupervised, but anything works), and if you even have some ideas how I could improve performance. I can train on small subsets of data, but the results only get better when using large amounts of data (at least 7 million events).

To see how it reacts to the classic Single - Link problem, why don't you just try yourself? Roughly, because of the way centroid linkage works, it may end up using a virtual cluster center that is outside of the actual cluster. You then may see some very weird links to happen.

It is known that the results of hierarchical agglomerative clustering using single-link method in order to determine the inter-cluster distance suffer form the chain-effect (natural clusters tend to extend trough a line of few points, like in the image below).

They mention that the original problem is that the way Netflix used the 5 - star rating was not standard within the industry : Netflixs Cameron Johnson, who oversaw the shift, told Business Insider that it all came from the realization that Netflix had always used star ratings differently than the rest of the internet, but that this distinction wasn\\'t clear to users. And the way ratings were presented to the user discouraged them to contribute. Their solution was the thumbs up / thumbs down approach because it was more clear to the user that they were training an algorithm : So when looking for a replacement, Netflix wanted to make sure that was clear. Thats why Netflix settled on thumbs up / down, \" which is widely understood to imply that you are training an algorithm to know what you like, Johnson said. I suspect there is more than that thought, and maybe binary data is simply \" good enough \". This chapter from Mining of Massive Datasets has some interesting considerations on ratings versus boolean utility matrices. From page 339 : If the utility matrix is not Boolean, e. g., ratings 15, then we can weight the vectors representing the profiles of items by the utility value. It makes sense to normalize the utilities by subtracting the average value for a user. Specially when treating rating matrices one need to be aware that different users may have different understanding of ratings, hence you will most likely normalise the matrix before calculating the recommendations, while for binary data this is not required.

Systems I notice that Netflix, which I think used to use a five-star scale for rating content and give predicted ratings for unrated content on the same scale, now just has basic like/dislike buttons.  Music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify seem to employ the same approach.  My question is what makes a binary response superior to a likert-type scale when it comes to generating the best recommendations?    Is it related to the nature of the algorithms (e.g., classifications are more accurate when there are fewer possible responses)? Or is the advantage more to do with human psychology (easier for users to accurately choose between like/dislike as opposed to love/like/neutral/dislike/hate)? '},\n"," '7942': {'actual:': 'It depends on how similarity is defined. If similarity is defined as human - defined semantics, then a synset ( i. e., synonym set ) is most appropriate. If similarity is defined as frequent co - occurrence, then word embeddings are most appropriate. Even within semantic similarity, there are many approaches beyond synsets. One advantage of word embeddings over synsets is the ability to automatically find similarity with multi - word term vocabulary.

embeddings to find similar words? One of the applications of word embeddings (such as GloVe) is finding words of similar meaning. I just had a look at some embeddings produced by glove on large datasets and I found that the nearest neighbors of a given word are often fairly irrelevant. Eg. dad is the closest neighbor of mom, dealership is the seventh closest neighbor of car.   In light of this, if you wanted to find words of similar semantics why would you prefer using embeddings instead of just downloading a database of synonyms from an online dictionary that is compiled by humans?  '},\n"," '8067': {'actual:': 'Convolution ( as a term ) matches with what we are trying to do in a CNN : we are building a ( sort of ) filter to extract certain feature from a signal. What is the output of the filter when a given image ( vector ) is given as input? Best thought of as convolution between the input and the filter. Correlation ( as a term ) would be preferred when we are dealing with two signals / inputs. Probably bit misleading applied to CNN feature extraction operation. I think this is more to do with terminology. The magnitude will be same as you suggest. Flipping happens because convolution is generally calculated after flipping the filter vector representation.

Why is convolution filter used instead of correlation filter in CNN? '},\n"," '8095': {'actual:': \"There are many ways to see how texts are similar, but this will depend on your use case. Semantics Nowadays, word embeddings are getting popular. Like it was suggested in the comments, you could use Doc2Vec to transform your sentence into a vector and calculate the cosine distance from each sentence. The idea with these learned embeddings is that you kind of encode the meaning of the sentence by looking how words are used in context. So, to sentences would be similar if words are used in the same manner in a context. However, this could potentially be difficult to interpret. For example : Good tattoo shop. Clean space. Good pizza restaurant. Large space. Terrible tattoo shop. Dirty space. Which of these are semantically close? It will depend a lot on your training and your own judgment to tell if the results are useful to you. Sentiment Maybe you are interested in saying that sentences are similar if their sentiment is positive or negative ( or on some other scale ). For example : Suppose you can have sentiment on a scale $ [ - 1, 1 ] $, where $ - 1 $ is negative, $ 0 $ is neutral and $ 1 $ is positive. Good tattoo shop. Clean space. Sentiment = 0. 7 Good pizza restaurant. Large space. Sentiment = 0. 75 Terrible tattoo shop. Dirty space. Sentiment = - 0. 9 There are many resources online on how to do this. Here is an answer with some links. BoW The bag - of - words is a very simple approach, but depending on what you are doing, it could do the trick. Suppose you want to say that sentences are similar if they are about a business in the same industry. You can make a simple dictionary for every industry : word _ per _ industry = {'restaurants'= ['restaurant ','food ','chef ','dish ','salad ','lunch'],'tatto _ shop'= ['clean ','dirty ','art ','sterlized']... } Then, per sentences, you can count which business has more words in the sentence, and if sentences are from the same industry they are similar. Of course, you could also make lists based on another characteristic, not necessarily on industries.

Main purpose of my work is to train a model which can do a binary classification of text. And for this purpose, I have around 3000 label data and 60000 unlabeled data available to me. My data type is related to instructions (like- open the door[label-1], give me a cup of water[label-1], give me money[label-0] etc.) In this case, I heard that Transferring knowledge from other models will help me a lot. Can anyone give me some useful resource for transfer learning in NLP domain?  I already did a few experiments. I used GLoVE as a pretrained embeddings. Then test it with my label data. But got around 70% accuracy. Also tried with embedding built using my own data (63k) and then train the model. Got 75% accuracy on the test data. My model architecture is given below-   Q1: I have a quick question will it be referred to as Transfer learning if I use GLOVE embeddings in model?  Any kind of help is welcomed.

I would greatly appreciate if you could let me know whether I should omit highly correlated features before using Lasso logistic regression (L1) to do feature selection.  In fact, I want to use logistic regression with L1 to do prediction as well as feature selection. However, some of my features are highly correlated e.g., -1 or 0.9. Should I omit them before applying Lasso or let the Lasso decide it?  Really, I read in Mr. Raschkas book (Python Machine Learning) that      regularization is a very useful method to handle collinearity (high   correlation among features).   However, this kernel  (by referring to Wikipedia) states that keeping correlated features in the model would adversely affect the feature selection but it doesn't impair the predictions.  \"},\n"," '8516': {'actual:': 'I would recommend breaking the problem down a little bit to reduce the memory usage at any one time. The first part of your main function gets the IDs using getIDList. That seems fine, so leave it there. I would then break that list down into smaller chunks, calling get3Dmatrix on each chunk in turn. Altering your code, it might look something like this : # Get number of entries in ID list N = len ( ID _ list ) # break it down into a number of chunks e. g. 4, based on your progress bar import numpy as np # should already be imported N = len ( ID _ list ) num _ chunks = 4 # you can play with this number, making it larger until you don\\'t get emmory errors chunks = np. linspace ( 0, N, num _ chunks ) for i in range ( len ( chunks ) - 1 ) : this _ sublist = ID _ list [ chunks [ i ] : chunks [ i + 1 ] ] sub _ data _ set = get3Dmatrix ( this _ sublist ) # At this point, either save this sub _ data _ set, or try appending it to another list toi make one final numpy matrix at the end before saving... print ( \" Begin saving in numpy file \" ) np. save ( output _ path +\\'np _ ds ( 10000 ) - 25 - 25 - 25 ( zyx ) _ one _ hot. npy \\', Data _ set ) print ( \" % s time takes in seconds \" % ( time. time ( ) - start _ time ) ) Even from the traceback you added, it is hard to say where exactly in your code that is happening.

for face recognition. I am using the pre-trained model VGG16.  The dataset has around 100 classes, and each class have 80 images. I split the dataset 60% training, 20% validation, 20% testing. I used data augmentation (ImageDataGenerator()) to increase the training data.  The model gave me different results when I change ImageDataGenerator() arguments. See the following cases:  Case1:   train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(     rotation_range=15,     width_shift_range=0.2,     height_shift_range=0.2,     shear_range=0.2,     zoom_range=0.2,     horizontal_flip=True,     fill_mode='nearest') validate_datagen = ImageDataGenerator() Test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator()   Case1 result: High training accuracy and validation accuracy, but the training accuracy is lower. check the following image:     Case2:  train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(       rescale=1./255,       shear_range=0.2,       zoom_range=0.2,       horizontal_flip=True)  validate_datagen = ImageDataGenerator()     Test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator()   Case2 result: Overfitting. check the following image:    Case3:  train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(       rescale=1./255,       shear_range=0.2,       zoom_range=0.2,       horizontal_flip=True)  validate_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)     Test_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)   Case3 result: High training accuracy and validation accuracy, but the training accuracy is lower.. check the following image:    1-  Why does using augmentation in validation and testing data ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255) in case3 give different result than case2?  2- Is adding ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255) to the testing and validation better than not adding it?  3- Do you think there is a problem in the result of the first case? \"},\n"," '8809': {'actual:': 'Here\\'s the question : is rewarding the agent for going into the right direction a \" correct approach \" in Reinforcement Learning? It depends on what you are hoping the agent is capable of learning by itself. This is an issue for you here, because you have a \" toy \" problem where you can control a lot more of the environment and alter the meaning of what it means to win. In general, then yes this is \" cheating \", at least in terms of claiming to have written an RL agent that solves the game. The academically ideal basic RL agent is rewarded by the gain of something meaningful in the context of the problem being solved, and is not helped by interim rewards. In a game of snake, and any other arcade - style game, it should really be the official points scored in the game and nothing else. Is passing the coordinates of the food as state an other way of \" cheating \"? Again it depends on what you expect the agent to learn from. If, in your target production environment, this data was easy to obtain, and you intended to use it to write a game bot working from the trained policy, then this is fine. There is no requirement that you do one thing or another if you have a practical problem to solve. However, learning from a pixel - only state, as in the DQN original papers, is of academic interest, because that is a generic state representation that applies to many problems, whilst the distance from the snake to food is a specific feature that you have engineered that makes learning easier in a smaller set of games. The main issue here is again that your goal is not really to put a \" snake bot \" into a production system, but to learn how RL works. RL is tricky, and often doesn\\'t work as well as you expect - or at all, for many combinations of algorithm and problem. It is worth reading this article : Deep Reinforcement Learning Doesn\\'t Work Yet - it may put disappointing results from basic DQN into perspective. I would encourage you to strip back your Snake problem to remove \" helpful \" rewards and state, and instead look into extensions to the core DQN algorithm, or different learning agents such as A3C.

Game Bot that learns how to play the videogame Snake with Deep Q-Learning. I tried with different neural networks and hyper-parameters, and I found a working set-up, for a specific set of rewards.  The problem is is: when I reward the agent for going in the right direction - positive rewards in case the coordinates of the agent increase or decrease accordingly to the coordinates of the food - the agent learns pretty fast, obtaining really high scores. When I don\\'t reward the agent for that, but only negative rewards for dying and positive for eating the food, the agent does not learn. The state takes into account if there\\'s any danger in proximity, if the food is up, down, right or left and if the agent is moving up, down, right or left.  Here\\'s the question: is rewarding the agent for going into the right direction a \"correct approach\" in Reinforcement Learning? Or it\\'s seen as cheating, cause the system needs to learn that by itself? Is passing the coordinates of the food as state an other way of \"cheating\"?

Gradient Norm Scaling Gradient norm scaling involves changing the derivatives of the loss function to have a given vector norm when the L2 vector norm ( sum of the squared values ) of the gradient vector exceeds a threshold value. For example, we could specify a norm of 1. 0, meaning that if the vector norm for a gradient exceeds 1. 0, then the values in the vector will be rescaled so that the norm of the vector equals 1. 0. 2. Gradient Value Clipping Gradient value clipping involves clipping the derivatives of the loss function to have a given value if a gradient value is less than a negative threshold or more than the positive threshold. For example, we could specify a norm of 0. 5, meaning that if a gradient value was less than - 0. 5, it is set to - 0. 5 and if it is more than 0. 5, then it will be set to 0. 5. 3.

This aspect points to incompleteness in the data you're feeding your algorithms, and imputing is simply a technique meant to fill gaps. Data imputation's motivation is to make feature distribution in your sets the closest possible to whatever real - world distribution it attempts to portray. The intuition behind why the median is what worked better for your scenario is not something I could be precise about without having access to the data you worked upon, but the positive result is deeply related to your feature distribution, which for the missing points in your data is better represented by the feature's median than all other metrics you've calculated. I'd recommend reading material such as this article that both explains and shows implementation of different imputation techniques - KNN, as you mentioned, being one of them. One of the advantages is seeing how different methods work for a given distribution : As you have already pointed in the end of your question, methods such as KNN are some straightforward means of imputation that could benefit your case better than mean / median imputation. The biggest difference between those is that KNN better preserves the variance in your data, whereas mean imputation ( as you can see from the above image ) shifts missing data towards a single value. Since no method is 100 % globally optimal, I'd advise you to try them - KNN, Multiple Interpolation and the likes - and compare.

\"Training offer - suttonyn levels of software i. e. linear regression or neural networks. basically, you have to zero mean vector sizes them. to train a model, you need to mask it multiple times with all the predictors. the real problem is that complexity is not a non - linear function, so you don't have to include all the details of the original data, but you need to iteratively 65 every time you have done a model in this case to arrive at a very digits where you are not predicting a single number. the good news is here\",\n","  'question:': \"Handling missing values to optimize polynomial features I was playing around with some data to practice my Python and machine learning skills and wanted to create polynomial features from two features that I think are related and have a strong influence on the predicted output.  Unfortunately my data has missing values (np.NaN) and sklearn's PolynomialFeatures() can not handle these values. What is the best way to impute these values?  I've been trying to replace them with 0, 1, mean and median and for my dataset using the median seems to be the best solution. But can this be generalized and what is the intuition behind it?  I was also wondering if filling methods like ffill, bfill or even KNN modelling can be useful in this context.  Thanks a lot! \"},\n"," '9405': {'actual:': \"Yep - you've overfitted! Can you see what your accuracy is as a function of the number of training cycles? It would be interesting to see how that looks. Is there any way you could increase your data? 15000x300 isn't a huge amount of depth for a neural network, considering the width of the data set.

If you can see that, why should your model not be able to? Just train it and see if it works. However, your dataset does not seem to be very large. You should think about transfer learning from some pre - trained model if your images / objects are not too strange. There is no a priori need to handle an imbalance of labels, just be sure to compare your loss to a proper baseline, e. g. the label mean. You said you have additional features, append them after flattening the convolutional layers. If the additional features are also 2D, just add them as a channel to your Input.

deal with realistically imbalanced dataset for Regression problem I have a dataset where each object has a label between 0-1. Objects with label = 1 are very common but those with label = 0 are very rare. I am interested in predicting the label in unseen data.    NOTE: The labels are continuous between 0 and 1 but binned for visual purposes.   These objects are from a simulation which accurately predicts the population numbers which we see in reality. (Hence the \"realistically imbalanced\" title)  Unfortunately, an object with label = 0 exhibits random looking motion and therefore the number of ways in which you can construct these objects tends to infinity..whereas those with label = 1 are highly ordered objects with not many variations in their structure and so have a limited number of ways in which they can appear.   To me this means that, in order to explore all possible variations of these objects in their domain would require a dataset who\\'s \"number of each class\" would be the complete opposite as we see in the figure above. i.e. you need to observe exponentially more label ~ 0 objects than label = 1 objects in order to explore the objects\\' domain.   Obviously this is impossible and impractical. I\\'m curious as to what people think is the best method of approaching this issue?  I have thought about:   Making this an object detection method whereby you discriminate between objects with label greater than or below a threshold such as 0.8. (I think this would be difficult given that the labels are continuous and so you would get muddying at the boundary). Joining two CNNs: one which models features that describe the label such as velocity data, and one which models properties that somehow link the level of physical randomness in the images to the corresponding labels.   I have already tried upsampling with a CNN classifier but with so few label ~ 0 images, the CNN quickly overfits and defaults to predicting them with a higher label.

I tried pip installation for jupyter and it worked fine. python - m pip install jupyter First try this : conda remove { failing _ packages } conda install { failing _ packages } Where { failing _ packages } is / are the package ( s ) for which an error is reported. If that fails, you could try forcing an over - install ( this solution is very handy and will likely fix many issues ) : conda install - f { failing _ packages } So, for example, for the original poster of this question, it would be ; conda remove ipython notebook conda install - f ipython notebook Note that in future releases of Conda, the - f will be removed and you may have to use - - clobber or - - force - reinstall flags. I personally like to use the - - force - reinstall flag, and worst case scenario I will remove the failing package's directory ( i. e. ~ / miniconda3 / pkgs / { failing _ package }... ) manually before using the - - force - reinstall to re - install it. That always works really well to fix any package issue. If all that fails, try these steps, one by one, in order, till it works : conda clean - - packages - - tarballs conda clean - - all conda update conda conda activate base conda install - - revision 0 Please note that each command has implication as to your environment.

Then you can experiment with different clustering algorithms and see what works. What comes to mind is dynamic time warping ( DTW ). DTW gives you a way to find a measure of \" distance \" ( it is actually not strictly a distance metric, but it is close ) between two time series. One very useful thing is that it can be used to compare two time series that are of different lengths. There are many good blog posts on DTW, so I won\\'t try to give yet another explanation of it. There are also many python implementations of it. And a lot of work has gone into making the algorithm very fast. DTW is a strange algorithm - - in some ways very simplistic, but typically works well. Once you modify the algorithm to deal with paths, you can construct the distance matrix and use that for clustering. One common clustering algorithm that is used in conjunction with DTW is spectral clustering, since the distance matrix can be used directly ( instead of the matrix of data points, which we don\\'t have here ).

Also, the Further Considerations section, I think, explains what the various components represent and addresses your questions. A short summary of what those sections describe is that the original components ( i. e., axes ) of the data don\\'t properly represent the relationship inherit in the data. Instead, the components can be combined to yield a new set of components, or axes, that better describe how the data is distributed. The wiki link states that \" PCA can be thought of as fitting an n - dimensional ellipsoid to the data \". In that line of thinking, the output of PCA is the eigenvectors and eigenvalues that define the orientation and length of the ellipsoid that best fits the data. What you do with that ellipsoid is up to you and your application of PCA. I agree with dpmcmlxxvi\\'s answer that the common \" output \" of PCA is computing and finding the eigenvectors for the principal components and the eigenvalues for the variances, but I can\\'t add comments yet and would still like to contribute. Once you hit this step of calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the principal components, you can do many types of analyses depending on your needs. I believe the \" output \" you are specifically asking about in your question is the resultant data set of applying a transformation or projection of the original data set into the desired linear subspace ( of n - dimensions ). This is taking the output of PCA and applying it on your original data set. This PCA step by step example may help. The ultimate output of this 6 step analysis was the projection of a 3 dimensional data set into 2 dimensions. Here are the high level steps : Taking the whole dataset ignoring the class labels Compute the d - dimensional mean vector Computing the scatter matrix ( alternatively, the covariance matrix ) Computing eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues Ranking and choosing k eigenvectors Transforming the samples onto the new subspace Ultimately, step 4 is the \" output \" since that is where the common requirements for performing PCA are fulfilled. We can make different decisions at steps 5 and 6 and produce alternative output there. A few more possibilities : You could decide to project the observations with outliers removed Another possible outcome here would be to calculate the proportion of variance explained by one or any combination of principal components. For example, the proportion of variance explained by the first two principal components of K components is ( 1 + 2 ) / ( 1 + 2 +... + K ). After plotting the projected observations into the first two principal components ( as in the given example ), you can impose a plot of the loadings of each of the original dimensions into the subspace ( scaled by the standard deviation of the principal components ). This way, we can see the contribution of the original dimensions ( in your case a - e ) to principal component 1 and 2. The biplot is another common product of PCA.

Principal Component Analysis? I'm trying to understand PCA, but I don't have a machine learning background.  I come from software engineering, but the literature I've tried to read so far is hard for me to digest. As far as I understand PCA, it will take a set of datapoints from an N dimensional space and translate them to an M dimensional space, where N   M.  I don't yet understand what the actual output of PCA is. For example, take this 5 dimensional input data with values in the range [0,10): // dimensions: // a  b  c  d  e  [[ 4, 1, 2, 8, 8],      // component 1  [ 3, 0, 2, 9, 8],  [ 4, 0, 0, 9, 1],  ...  [ 7, 9, 1, 2, 3],      // component 2  [ 9, 9, 0, 2, 7],  [ 7, 8, 1, 0, 0]]  My assumption is that PCA could be used to reduce the data from 5 dimensions to, say, 1 dimension. Data details: There are two  components  in the data.  One component has mid a levels, low b and c levels, high d, and nondeterministic e levels. The other component has high a and b levels, low c and d levels, and nondeterministic e levels.  This means that the two components are most differentiated by b and d, somewhat differentiated by a, and negligibly differentiated by c and e. Outputs? I'm making this up, but say the (non-normalized) linear combination with the highest differentiating power is something like 5*a + 10*b + 0*c + 10*d + 0*e  The above input data translated along that single axis is: [[110],  [105],  [110],  ...etc  Is that linear combination (or a vector describing it) the output of PCA?  Or is the output the actual reduced dataset?  Or something else entirely? \"},\n"," '9760': {'actual:': \"Concatenate was fine. By concatenating, you give to your network access to all information it needs to predict the output. The order does not matter. By averaging, you crunch your data into something smaller : something that represent your data in a less informative way. That's why your loose accuracy : you are giving to your network less information to learn from. What you need to do is get more data. Your initial approach is fine, you just need enough data for your network to learn that when the data represent a 90 degree - rotation, the output should be the same. I have found the solution.

invariance neural network in keras? My question is about the structure of the network required to solve my problem with fewer data.  I have a sensor device that simply reports the color of the thing it's seeing in front of it. One sensor reports me 4 numbers: Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha.  The intensity of the color changes depends on the distance and the thing it's seeing. I have 6 such sensors attached on each side of a small cube. The cube can be moved and rotated using the hand.  I want to predict the position of the cube in space in real-time.  My problem:  Input: 6 identical sensors, each giving 4 numbers. Total=6*4=24 numbers.  Output: 3 numbers, X, Y, Z, (Position of the cube)  I have my data ready with label XYZ.  Now, train a simple Multi-layer perceptron which takes 24 numbers and output 3 numbers. This is working quite fine but it needs hell lots of data in a cubic meter space to predict accurately.  The problem is about the rotation. I need to rotate and cover 360 degrees for every location for it to predict well.  But I know for the fact that each sensor is identical so I want to share the weight of each sensor. I know that when you rotate the cube 90 degrees, it should not affect the output position at all. So this should mean the order of the sensors is not important. This means I should somehow use add or average to merge my sensors' layer. If I use concatenate it will preserve the order which make the output position changes.  The way I'm doing it is that I feed 4 numbers into a sensor model that are shared among all sensors, get the encoding, add them up, then connect it to Dense layers. Following is the model prototype:  from keras.layers import Input, Dense from keras.models import Model, Sequential  sensor1 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor2 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor3 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor4 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor5 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor6 = Input(shape=(4,)) sensor_model = Sequential([     Dense(64, activation='relu'),     Dense(64, activation='relu'), ]) sensor1_encoding = sensor_model(sensor1) sensor2_encoding = sensor_model(sensor2) sensor3_encoding = sensor_model(sensor3) sensor4_encoding = sensor_model(sensor4) sensor5_encoding = sensor_model(sensor5) sensor6_encoding = sensor_model(sensor6) sensor_encoding = average([     sensor1_encoding,     sensor2_encoding,     sensor3_encoding,     sensor4_encoding,     sensor5_encoding,     sensor6_encoding, ]) h = sensor_encoding h = Dense(128, activation='relu')(h) h = Dense(128, activation='relu')(h) h = Dense(3, activation='linear') model = Model(inputs=[sensor1, sensor2, sensor3, sensor4, sensor5, sensor6], outputs=[h])   Right now, when I change the average function to concatenate, the model loss is lower on both training and validation set which contradicts with my intuition. What is wrong with my thinking? What do you think? How do I adjust this model in order for it to predict the same position if I rotate 90 degrees while also not suffering from 45 degrees rotation. And also make it in such a way that it does not remove the useful relationship between the inputs. \"},\n"," '9821': {'actual:': \"Yes, it is, there is no reason why a component cannot have negative values.

looking at these three parameters, the imbalance in your do environments are more reasonable whether the data becomes linearly separable. it seems to be your desired case ( but it isn't a 100 % sure

about the noise. in other words, as you have the time, select a subset of the positions labeled with simple clustering points ( kind of points ), would enhance the above to a join plot. this would
